<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Prologue</span></h2>
<p>Penfield twirled the stem of his port-glass between thumb and
finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but egocentric vanity to
consider our form of life as unique among those on the millions of
worlds that must exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they exist?&rdquo; said Hodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observation,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;The astronomers have proved that
other stars beside our sun have planets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing into his hands,&rdquo; observed Penfield, the heavy
eyebrows twitching as he cracked a nut. &ldquo;The statistical approach
is better. Why doesn&rsquo;t this glass of port suddenly boil and spout all
over the ceiling? You&rsquo;ve never seen a glass of port behave that way,
but the molecules that compose it are in constant motion, and any
physicist will tell you that there&rsquo;s no reason why they can&rsquo;t all decide
to move in the same direction at once. There&rsquo;s only an overwhelming
possibility that it won&rsquo;t happen. To believe that we, on
this earth, one of the planets of a minor star, are the only form of
intelligent life, is like expecting the port to boil any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a good many possibilities for intelligent life, though,&rdquo;
said McCall. &ldquo;Some Swede who wrote in German&mdash;I think his name
was Lundmark&mdash;has looked into the list. He says, for instance, that
a chlorine-silicon cycle would maintain life quite as well as the oxygen-carbon
system this planet has, and there&rsquo;s no particular reason
why nature should favor one form more than the other. Oxygen is
a very active element to be floating around free in such quantities
as we have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hodge, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t it be that the cycle you mention
is the normal one, and ours is the eccentricity?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Penfield, &ldquo;what in the world is the point you&rsquo;re
making? Pass the port, and let&rsquo;s review the bidding.&rdquo; He leaned
back in his chair and gazed toward the top of the room, where the
carved coats of arms burned dully at the top of the dark panelling.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that everything here is reproduced exactly somewhere
else in the universe, with three men named Hodge, McCall and
Penfield sitting down to discuss sophomore philosophy after a sound
dinner. The fact that we are here and under these circumstances is
the sum of all the past history of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodge laughed. &ldquo;I find the picture of us three as the crown of
human history an arresting one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confusing two different things. I didn&rsquo;t say we were elegant
creatures, or even desirable ones. But behind us there are
certain circumstances, each one of which is as unlikely as the
boiling port. For example, the occurrence of such persons as
Beethoven, George Washington, and the man who invented the
wheel. They are part of our background. On one of the other
worlds that started approximately as ours did, they wouldn&rsquo;t exist,
and the world would be altered by that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said McCall, &ldquo;that once you accept the idea
of worlds starting from approximately the same point&mdash;that is,
another planet having the same size and chemical makeup, and
about the same distance from its sun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I find hard to accept,&rdquo; said Hodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant us our folly for a moment,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;It leads to
something more interesting than chasing our tails.&rdquo; He snapped his
lighter. &ldquo;What I was saying is that if you grant approximately the
same start, you&rsquo;re going to arrive at approximately the same end,
in spite of what Penfield thinks. We have evidence of that right
on this earth. I mean what they call convergent evolution. When
the reptiles were dominant, they produced vegetable-eaters and
carnivores that fed on them. And among the early mammals there
were animals that looked so much like cats and wolves that the
only way to tell them apart is by the skeleton. Why couldn&rsquo;t that
apply to human evolution, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Penfield, &ldquo;that Beethoven and George Washington
would be inevitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, exactly,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;But some kind of musical
inventor, and some sort of high-principled military and political
leader. There might be differences.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Hodge said: &ldquo;Wait a minute. If we are the product of human
history, so were Beethoven and Washington. All you&rsquo;ve got is a
determinism, with nothing really alterable, once the sun decided to
cast off its planets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctrine of free will&mdash;&rdquo; began McCall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that one,&rdquo; said Penfield. &ldquo;But if you deny free will completely,
you&rsquo;ll end up with a universe in which every world like ours
is identical&mdash;which is as absurd as Hodge&rsquo;s picture of us is unique,
and rather more repulsive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Hodge, &ldquo;What kind of cosmology are you
putting out? If you won&rsquo;t have either of our pictures, give us
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penfield sipped port. &ldquo;I can only suggest a sample,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s suppose this world&mdash;or one very like it&mdash;with one of those
improbable boiling-port accidents left out somewhere along the
line. I mentioned the wheel a moment ago. What would life be like
now if it hadn&rsquo;t been invented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask McCall,&rdquo; said Hodge. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the technician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the wheel, no,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t buy that. It&rsquo;s too
logical a product of the environment. Happens as soon as a primitive
man perceives that a section of tree-trunk will roll. No. If
you&rsquo;re going to make a supposition, you&rsquo;ll have to keep it clean,
and think in terms of something that really might not have happened.
For example, music. There are lots of peoples, right here,
who never found the full chromatic scale, including the classical
civilizations. But I suppose that&rsquo;s not basic enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment or two, the three sipped and smoked in the unspoken
communication of friendship. A log collapsed in the fireplace,
throwing out a spray of sparks. McCall said: &ldquo;The steam
engine is a rather unlikely invention, when you come to think of
it. And most modern machines and their products are outgrowths
of it in one way or another. But I can think of one more peculiar
and more basic than that. Gunpowder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; said Hodge, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a specialized&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penfield. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s perfectly right. Gunpowder
destroyed the feudal system, and produced the atmosphere in
which your steam engine became possible. And remember that
all the older civilizations, even in the East, were subject to
periodic setbacks by barbarian invasions. Gunpowder provided
civilized man with a technique no barbarian could imitate, and
helped him over the difficult spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCall said; &ldquo;All the metal-working techniques and most of
chemistry depend on the use of explosives&mdash;basically. Imagine
digging out all the ores we need by hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said Hodge, &ldquo;have your fun. Let&rsquo;s imagine a
world like this one, in which gunpowder has never been invented.
What are you going to have it look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said McCall, &ldquo;but I think Penfield&rsquo;s wrong
about one point. About the feudal system, I mean. It was pretty
shaky toward the end, and the cannon that battered down the
castles only hurried up the process. There might be a lot more
pieces of the feudal system hanging around without gunpowder,
but the thing would be pretty well shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Hodge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve overlooked something
else. If you&rsquo;re going to eliminate gunpowder and everything that
came out of it, you&rsquo;ll have to replace it with something. After all,
a large part of the time and attention of our so-called civilization
have been spent in working out the results of the gunpowder and
steam engine inventions, If you take those away, you&rsquo;ll have a
vacuum, which I&rsquo;m told, nature abhors. There would have to be a
corresponding development in some other field, going &rsquo;way beyond
where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penfield drank and nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A development
along some line we&rsquo;ve neglected because we have been too
busy with mechanics. Why couldn&rsquo;t it be in the region of ESP,
or psychology or psychiatry&mdash;science of the mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the psychologists are just operating on the ordinary principles
of physical science,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;Observing, verifying
from a number of examples, and then attempting to predict. I don&rsquo;t
see how another race would have gone farther by being ignorant
of these principles or overlooking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being insular,&rdquo; said Penfield. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that in
another world they would have turned psychology into an exact
science in our terms. It might be something altogether different.
Your principles of science are developed along the lines of arithmetic.
The reason they haven&rsquo;t worked very well in dealing with the
human mind may be because they aren&rsquo;t applicable at all. There
may be quite a different line of approach. Think it over for a
moment. It might even be along the line of magic, witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;You want to make a difference by
substituting something phoney for something real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might not be phoney,&rdquo; insisted Penfield. &ldquo;Magic and
witchcraft are really pretty late in our world. They began to be
talked about at the same time and on the same terms as alchemy,
everything surrounded by superstition, lying and plain ignorance.
In this world we&rsquo;re imagining, somebody might have found the
key to something as basic in that field as gunpowder was to the
physical sciences. Some people say we almost made the discovery
here. You know the story about this house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>McCall nodded, but Hodge said: &ldquo;No. What is it? Another
ghost story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. The old part of the house, the one where the bedrooms
are now, is supposed to have been built by one of the Salem
witches. Not one of those they hanged on false charges, but a perfectly
genuine witch, who got away before she was suspected&mdash;as a
real witch probably would. The story is that she came here and set
up business among the Indians, and as they weren&rsquo;t very expert at
carpentry, she helped them build that part of the house with spells,
so it would be eternal. The old beams haven&rsquo;t a bit of iron in them;
they&rsquo;re all held together with pegs and haven&rsquo;t rotted a bit. There&rsquo;s
also a story that if you make the proper preparations at night, something
beyond the normal will happen. I&rsquo;ve never done the right
thing myself, apparently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Hodge. &ldquo;The essence of the whole
witchcraft business is uncertainty. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that in all
the legends, the spells never quite come off when they&rsquo;re needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably because there isn&rsquo;t any science of witchcraft,
with predictable results,&rdquo; said McCall.</p>
<p>Penfield said: &ldquo;It may be for another reason, too. Have you ever
noticed that magic is the only form of human activity which is
dominated by women? The really scary creatures are all witches;
when a man becomes a magician, he&rsquo;s either possessed of a devil
or is a glorified juggler. Our theoretical world would have to start
by being a matriarchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or contain the relics of one,&rdquo; said Hodge. &ldquo;Matriarchies are
socially unstable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is everything,&rdquo; said McCall. &ldquo;Flow and change from one
form to another is a characteristic of life&mdash;or maybe a definition of
life. That goes for your witchcraft, too. It would change form,
there&rsquo;d be resistance to it, and an effort to find something to replace
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to remove the disabilities,&rdquo; said Hodge. &ldquo;The difficulty with
any power we don&rsquo;t really know about is not to define the power
itself, but to discover its limitations. If witchcraft were really practical,
there would be some fairly severe penalties going with it, not
legally I mean, but personally, as a result of the practice. Or to put
the thing in your terms, McCall, if there weren&rsquo;t any drawbacks,
being a witch would have such high selection value that before long
every female alive would be a practicing witch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>McCall carefully poured more port. &ldquo;Hodge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
wonderful, and I love you. But that&rsquo;s typical of the way you put
things. You cover up a weak point by following it with one that
attracts everyone&rsquo;s attention away from the feebleness of your real
case. Penalties for everything? What&rsquo;s the penalty for having an
electric icebox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pampered digestive system,&rdquo; said Hodge, readily. &ldquo;I doubt
whether you could survive the food Queen Elizabeth ate for very
long, but she lived to be well over sixty. If there were witchcraft,
or ESP or telepathy running around in the world, there couldn&rsquo;t
but be defenses against it and troubles for the practitioners. Had
it occurred to you that even a witch couldn&rsquo;t spend all her time
stirring cauldrons, and might want to lead a normal life, with a husband
and children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penfield got up and stepped to the window, where he stood
looking out and down at the midnight Atlantic, throwing its surges
against the breast of the rocks. &ldquo;I wonder if it really does exist,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Hodge laughed; but that night all three men dreamed: and it
was as though a filament ran through the ancient rooms; for each
knew that he dreamed, and dreamed the same dream as the others;
and from time to time tried to cry out to them, but could only see
and hear.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">1</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NETZNEGON CITY: MARCH RAIN</span></h2>
<p>It was raining steadily outside. The older woman&rsquo;s tears and
words fell in time, drip, drip. Cold, for the tall window at the room&rsquo;s
end would never quite shut close, bottom and top not nest into the
frame simultaneously. Lalette in her soutane felt goose-pimples and
tried to shut out the sound by thinking of a man with a green hat
who would give her a handful of gold scudi and nothing asked,
merely because it was spring and she put a small spell on him
with a smile, but it was not quite spring, and the voice persisted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;. . . all my life&mdash;I have hoped&mdash;hoped and planned for you&mdash;even
before you were born&mdash;even before you were born&mdash;daughter
of my own&mdash;&rdquo; (Yes, thought Lalette, I have heard that before, and
it would move me more, but the night you drank the wine with
Dame Carabobo, you told her how I was the product of a chance
union in a carriage between Rushaca and Zenss) &ldquo;&mdash;daughter&mdash;and
after I saved and worked so hard&mdash;you miss the only chance&mdash;the
only chance&mdash;don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do&mdash;and Count Cleudi&rsquo;s
not like most&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him what he offered was frightful. I heard you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Sob) &ldquo;It was. Oh, it was. Oh, Lalette, it isn&rsquo;t right, you should
be married with a gold coach and six horses&mdash;but what can we do?&mdash;oh,
if your father had left us anything before the war&mdash;all I sacrificed
for him&mdash;but that is what all of us must do, make sacrifices, we
can&rsquo;t have anything real without giving something away . . . Lalette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be able to employ the Art and have everything you
want, you know most of the patterns already, he does not go to the
Service often . . . and after all, it&rsquo;s something that happens to every
woman one way or another, and with the Art, even if he doesn&rsquo;t
marry you, he&rsquo;ll find you a husband you won&rsquo;t mind, it&rsquo;s only men
like Cleudi who want to be the first, a man who marries would
really prefer a girl to have a little experience, I know . . . Lalette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the young ones come to the ball after the opera, Lalette.
Count Cleudi will present you, and even if you don&rsquo;t bring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He would have not only a green hat, but southern-made lace at
wrist and throat and a funny-looking man who spoke in a Mayern
accent, thick as cream, and carried the purse because it spoiled the
fit&mdash;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . as though he were just one of those . . . so considerate . . .&rdquo;
(I suppose we cannot control how we come by our parents) &ldquo;. . .
your father, like an angel out of heaven, and I could have taught
you so much more if he&mdash;&rdquo; (Now she is waist-deep in the past again,
I&rsquo;m going to hear it all over) &ldquo;. . . really, for it is more like one step
up than a leap down from a high place, which is always what we
think before the first time . . . Lalette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s mother hastily daubed at her cheeks, heaved herself
heavily from the chair, looked sidewise, saying; &ldquo;We could sell the
stone.&rdquo; But before the girl could reply, the tap again. The older
woman waddled across to the door and opened it a crack; a long
jaw and long nose under a wet turn-down hat poked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just saying to my daughter&mdash;&rdquo; began Dame Leonalda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>A pair of thin shoulders pushed past her as though not hearing,
the man stood in the center of the room, sniffed and wiped his nose
on his sleeve. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no more stories. I have heard too
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Leonalda gave him a doleful look and bustled back to her
seat. &ldquo;But I assure you, Ser Ruald&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more stories,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I have charges to meet and
taxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands to her face. (Lalette thought: her only device;
I hope I shall not grow like that.) Ruald said; &ldquo;But I do not wish to
be hard, no, and I know you have no money just now. So I will be
fair, and if you render me a small service, why then, it is not beyond
me to forgive the whole four months&rsquo; arrears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Leonalda took down her hands again and said; &ldquo;What is
the service?&rdquo; (Her voice had something like a tinge of dread.)</p>
<p>Ruald sniffed again, darted a glance at Lalette, another at the
door, and stepped close. &ldquo;I have heard that you belong to one of the
families of the Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter. Is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dame&rsquo;s lips worked. &ldquo;And what if it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this, dame: it will not peril your soul to place a small witchery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I couldn&rsquo;t do such a thing. You have no right to ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face sneered. &ldquo;I have a right to ask you for my
money, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I tell you.&rdquo; Her hands waved the air. &ldquo;That Dame Sauglitz,
they punished her with five years and stripes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will punish nobody for this; utterly private between you
and myself. Is not your skill enough so that no suspicion of witchery
will fall on you? Come, I&rsquo;ll do better. I&rsquo;ll more than forgive the arrears,
I&rsquo;ll give you quit-rent for four other months to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Lalette from the corner.</p>
<p>Dame Leonalda turned around. &ldquo;This does not concern you,&rdquo; she
said, and to Ruald; &ldquo;But how am I to know that having done as you
wish, you&rsquo;ll not denounce me before the episcopals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why as for that, might I not want your help another time?&rdquo; She
put up a protesting hand, but he; &ldquo;Come, no more stories. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another tap at the door. Ruald looked annoyance as
Dame Leonalda crossed the room in another rustle of skirts. Her
voice was almost gay. &ldquo;Come in, Uncle Bontembi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rain shook shining from his cloak. &ldquo;Ah, charming Dame Leonalda.&rdquo;
The paunch hindered his bow. &ldquo;The greetings of the evening to
you, Ser Ruald. Why, this is a true evening gathering.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was just leaving,&rdquo; said Ruald, tugging at his jacket. &ldquo;Well,
then, Dame Leonalda, bear in mind what I have said. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll
reach accommodation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not get up as he went. When the door was closed she
turned to Uncle Bontembi. &ldquo;It is such a problem, dear Uncle,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Of course the child is perfectly right in a way, and it would
be different if her father had left her anything at all, but with such
a man as Cleudi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Count is a splendid gentleman,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;I have
seen him lose fifty gold scudi on a turn, but never his composure.
And he is in high favor. Is there a problem relative to him? Not that
his eye has fallen on our little Lalette? I would call that a matter
for consent and rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Uncle, it is this, if men only behaved as nobly toward women
as they do to each other! He has set his eye on this dear child
indeed, but not his hand, and says he will pay all our debts and give
her a hundred gold scudi besides, if she will only accompany him
to the opera and ball of the spring festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Bontembi plucked at the button of his chin, and the smile
left his face. &ldquo;Hm, hm, it is certainly on the face of matters a proposal
. . . You are certain you have not been employing the Art,
Dame Leonalda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, never, never. And my dear little girl, how could she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest glanced sly-eye at the girl. &ldquo;Yes, yes, she has her first
confession to make. Well, well, let us think this out together. I will
say the Count Cleudi is highly held in other circles beside the political.
There was some theological discussion at the Palace Bregatz
lately, and the Episcopal was of the opinion that he had never heard
sounder doctrine or better put than by Cleudi. Wherefore he cannot
be very far from the laws of the good God and right moral, can he?
And so his plan may be of greater benefit than first appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want such benefits,&rdquo; said Lalette, (but thought: then I
should have the Art!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! Our junior niece resists; this is not the true humility.
Come, Demoiselle Lalette, let us look at it this way: we can only
truly serve good and vanquish the eternal forces of evil through
the happiness of others, for if it is our own happiness we seek, then
others doing the same will make all unhappy, and so give victory to
evil.&rdquo; He signed himself. &ldquo;Thus to bring joy to others is the true
service of religion and moral, no matter what the appearance may
say. Now in this case there would be three people given happiness.
Yes, yes, the doctrinal point is somewhat delicate, but I cannot find
it in my mind to disapprove. There is a technical violation of moral
law involved, and I am afraid the Church will have to assess a certain
fine against you, but I will make it as light as possible. Enough
to remind that a good action should be done for moral gain and not
material.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not love him,&rdquo; said Lalette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more unselfish, all the more.&rdquo; The priest turned to Dame
Leonalda. &ldquo;Have you not made it clear to our niece that the true
love which puts down evil in the name of the major glory of God is
something that rises out of and after union? Why, if she talks so, I
will have to lay church-duty on her for approaching the doctrines
of the Prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have told her, I have told her.&rdquo; (The mother&rsquo;s voice
began to cloud toward another rain of tears.) &ldquo;But she is so
romantical and sensitive, my little daughter, just like those poems
by Terquid. When I was a girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette let her face smooth out (as she thought about the opera
ball and what it would be like), but even that was not much
use, their voices kept picking at her until she went behind the
curtain to her bed in the corner, where it was even colder
beneath the blanket at first, so that she curled up tight. (If I
were really married, the Blue Star would belong to me and my
husband, and . . .)</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;But is it a genuine Blue Star?&rdquo; asked Pyax. He turned toward
Dr. Remigorius, who should know if anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Of that I cannot say. We have been deceived before. It
is certain that the old woman has practised veritable witcheries;
the Center of Veierelden found a record of a conviction against
her in the church there. The only surety is in the test; and that
is a test that only Friend Rodvard here can make. If it should
be genuine, our game&rsquo;s won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lower lip of Pyax hung open among his pimples and
Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s ravaged face changed line. &ldquo;It would be wo-onderful
to have it,&rdquo; she said, drawing out the long sound, and Rodvard
felt the blood run warm beneath his skin as they all looked at
him. &ldquo;But I do not think her mother would permit a marriage,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;How will you have me do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do? Do?&rdquo; said the doctor, the little white planes at the
corners of his mouth shining against the black fantastic cut of
his beard. &ldquo;Shall we school hens to lay eggs or rats to suck them
for you? Do what is most natural for a lad with a willing girl
in his arms, and the Blue Star is ours. Will you have Mme. Kaja
to teach you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>The flush warmed Rodvard, and he said; &ldquo;I&mdash;will you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin in the background opened his thin, tight lips. &ldquo;Our
friend is lapped in the obligation of the Church. Hey, Rodvard
Yes-and-No, what moral do you follow? If it&rsquo;s to be that of the
priests, you have no place with us. You are engaged as a soldier
to the overthrow of all they stand for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-oh, you are so wrong, friend Mathurin,&rdquo; said Mme. Kaja.
&ldquo;I understand. There is the heart&mdash;&rdquo; she pressed a hand to a
pendulous right breast &ldquo;&mdash;but as my old friend, the Baroness
Blenau used to say, hearts do not guide but to sorrow. Ah, friend
Rodvard, believe me, if one is to have the great peace, one must
deny the heart&rsquo;s message and seek the good of all beyond what
gives pain at the moment.&rdquo; She slapped her breast again and
turned to the others; &ldquo;I know; he is in love with another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without reason, Mathurin said suddenly; &ldquo;When I went to the
court service with Cleudi last night, the old hog was drunk
again. Fell on the floor at her royal prayers and had to be
helped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Remigorius; &ldquo;Will you still distract us, Mathurin? There
is but one present question before this Center&mdash;the bidding of
the High Center that friend Rodvard here obtain the Blue Star
from Lalette Asterhax. Can we report to them that the task is
undertaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pyax spoke, running his tongue across lips; &ldquo;If he will not, I
can offer through marriage and lawful lease. My father would
be willing to give a dower&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard burst into laughter with the rest, over the thought
there could be enough money in the world to buy a Dossolan
bedding for one of Pyax&rsquo; Zigraner birth. (But the laugh ended
bitterly for the young man at the thought that because they could
see no better way he must give up his ideal of honor and true
love. He tried to imagine how it would be to live with someone
who did not love one again, but whom for honor&rsquo;s sake he
must have married, and for a moment the intent candle-lit
faces dissolved away; he felt a momentary strange sweet painful
thrill before the picture in his mind changed to that of
his father and mother quarreling about money, and she began
to scream until his father, with contorted face, reached down
the cane from the mantel . . . Oh, if one gives in love, it should
be forever, ever, love and death&mdash;)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;still place him,&rdquo; Dr. Remigorius was saying, &ldquo;but that will
be a matter for the High Center. No, there&rsquo;s only the one thing,
and we&rsquo;ll have the answer now. Rodvard Bergelin, we summon
you by your oath to the Sons of the New Day and your desire
to overthrow the wicked rule of the Laughing Chancellor and
the old Queen, to take your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pyax smiled nastily. &ldquo;Remember Peribert? We know how to
deal with those who fall away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not good to be hard on those from whom you seek help,&rdquo;
said Mme. Kaja.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; said Remigorius. &ldquo;Young man, your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(One more effort.) &ldquo;Is it so vital that we have this jewel?&rdquo; said
Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Remigorius, simply; but Mathurin; &ldquo;This is the only
true Blue Star of which we have record, and even this one may
not be true. But if you will not make the effort to win it, as
ordered, there&rsquo;s still an escape. You are a clerk to the Office of
Pedigree; find another Blue Star that we can have, and you&rsquo;re
excused. But with matters so approaching a crisis at the court,
we must have one; for we are the weaker party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard saw Pyax touch his knife-hilt and once more wetly
run out his tongue, so like a lizard&rsquo;s. Beaten; had he not himself
in those long conversations until daybreak, maintained that among
free men the more voices must make the decisions? With a
sense that he was assuming an obligation to baseness, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do as you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Remigorius&rsquo; face cracked into a red-and-black smile.
&ldquo;Pfo, young man, you&rsquo;ll make a witch of her and she will
gain her fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. Kaja came over to take both his hands as he left. &ldquo;The
heart will follow,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">2</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">APRIL NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Lalette looked up through branches to the purpling sky, then
down from the little crest and across the long flat fertile fields,
reaching out toward the Eastern Sea, where night was rising. &ldquo;I
must go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My mother will be back from the service.&rdquo; Her
voice was flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Rodvard, lifting his head from arms wrapped
around his knees. &ldquo;You said she would stay to talk with the fat
priest. . . . In this light, your eyes are green.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is the sign of a bad temper, my mother tells me. She looked
in the waters for me once, and says that when I am married, I
will be a frightful shrew.&rdquo; (It was almost too much trouble to move,
she was glad even to make a slender line of conversation that would
hold her immobile in the calm twilight.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must be fated to marry a bad man. I do not see&mdash;if
you really loved someone, how could you be shrewish with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the girls of our heritage cannot marry for love. It is the
tradition of the witch-families.&rdquo; She sat up suddenly. &ldquo;Now I must
absolutely go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed his hand over hers, where it rested on the long green
moss under the cedars. &ldquo;Absolutely, I will not let you go. I will bind
you with hard bonds, till you tell me more about your family. Do
you really have a Blue Star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother does. . . . I do not know. My father would never use
it, that is why we are so poor. He said it was wrong and dangerous.
My mother&rsquo;s father used it though, she says, before she got it from
him. It was he who told her to choose my father. He was a Capellan
in the army, you know, and was killed in the war at the siege of
Sedad Mir. My mother&rsquo;s father could read through the Star that my
father wanted my mother for herself and not for her heritage. It was
a love-match, but now there is no one that can use the Star.&rdquo; (Lalette
thought: I really must not tell stories like that that are not true,
it only slipped out because I do not wish to go back and hear her
talking about Count Cleudi again.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not you sell it?&rdquo; asked Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would buy it? It would be a confession that someone
wanted to practice witchery, and then the priests would come down
and there&rsquo;d be a church trial. It is a very strange thing and a burden
to have witchery in one&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; She shuddered a little (attracted
and yet depressed, as always when it was a question of
That). &ldquo;I do not want to be a witch, ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I would think&mdash;&rdquo; began Rodvard, (really thinking that
in spite of her beauty, this was the reason she more than a little
repelled).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and have people hating me, and those who want to like me
not sure whether they really do, or whether it is only another
witchery. The only real friend my mother has is Uncle Bontembi,
and that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s a priest, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a real friend
either, but keeps watch of her so that when she makes a witchery
he can collect another fine for the Church.&rdquo; Rodvard felt the small
hand clench beneath his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry, and stay a virgin,
and will not be a witch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;What would happen to the Blue Star then? You have no sisters,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a brother, and he went overseas to Mancherei when the
Prophet began to preach there. Somebody said he went beyond to
the Green Isles afterward, when the Prophet left. We do not hear
from him any more. . . . But he couldn&rsquo;t use the Blue Star anyway,
unless he were bound with a girl from one of the other families,
who could witch it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overhead the sky was deepening, with one faint easterly star
agleam, a long slow smoke rose in convolutions from the chimney of
a cot down there, (and Rodvard thought desperately of the lovely
light-haired girl who had come so many times to search witch-family
records at his clerk&rsquo;s cabinet in the Office of Pedigree, but
she was a baron&rsquo;s daughter by her badge, and even if he did obtain
the Blue Star from this one, and used it to win the light-haired girl,
then Lalette would be a witch and put a spell on him&mdash;oh tangle!).
The hand within his stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said Lalette again. (He looks something like
Cleudi, she was thinking, but not so old and hard and a little romantic,
and he had eye enough to catch the wonderful tiny flash of
green among the blue when the sun dipped under.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no. You shall not go, not yet. This is a magic evening and
we will keep it forever till all&rsquo;s dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face softened a trifle in the fading light, but she pulled to
withdraw her hand. &ldquo;Truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clung the tighter, feeling heart-beat, vein-beat in the momentary
small struggle. &ldquo;What if I will not let you go till lantern-glass
and the gates are closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo;Then Uncle Bontembi will expect me to make a confession and
if I do not, he will put a fine on me, and it will be bad for my mother
because we are so poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I kept you, it would be to run away with you, ah, far
beyond the Shining Mountains, and live with you forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand went passive again, she leaned toward him a trifle, as
though to see more surely the expression on his face. &ldquo;Do you mean
that, Rodvard Bergelin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught breath. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why should I say it else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not. Let me go, let me go, or I&rsquo;ll make you.&rdquo; She half
turned, trying to rise, bringing the other hand to help pull loose his
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you witch me, witch?&rdquo; he cried, struggling, and his grasp
slipped to her wrist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;.&rdquo; She snatched at the held hand with the other, catching
the thumb and crying fiercely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break my own finger, I swear
it, if you do not let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. . . .&rdquo; He flung her two hands apart. Lithe as a serpent, she
wrung one and then the other from his grasp, but it was with an
effort that carried her off balance and supine asprawl. He rolled on
his hip to pin her down, hands on her elbows, breast to breast, and
was kissing her half-opened mouth till she stopped trying, turning
her face from his and whispering: &ldquo;Let me go. It&rsquo;s wrong. It&rsquo;s
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; and he released one hand to feel where the maddening
sensation of her breast came against him and the laces began.
(The thought was fleetingly seen in the <i>camera obscura</i> of his
inner mind that he did not love her and would have to pay for
this somehow.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she cried again in a strangled voice, and convulsing,
struck him on the side of the head with her free hand. At that
moment the laces gave, her hand came round his head instead of
against it, drawing his face down in a long sobbing kiss, through
which a murmur, softer than a whisper; &ldquo;All right, oh, all right, go
on.&rdquo; (There was one little flash of triumph across her mind, one
trouble solved, Cleudi would never want her now.)</p>
<p>Afterward, he knelt to kiss her skirt-hem. Her lips were compressed
at the center, a little raised at the corners. &ldquo;Now I understand,&rdquo;
said she; but he did not, and all the way home was eaten
by the most dreadful cold fear that she would revenge herself on
him with a witchery that would leave him stark idiot or smitten
with dreadful disease. And the other, the other; his mind would not
form her name, and there was a cry within him.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>All three of them were waiting, with that man of Count Cleudi&rsquo;s&mdash;the
olive-skinned one with such intense eyes&mdash;what was his name?
Lalette curtsied; Uncle Bontembi smiled. Said Cleudi; &ldquo;Mathurin,
the baskets. I commenced to think we should miss the pleasure of
your company tonight, charming Demoiselle Lalette, and my heart
was desolated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, (thinking&mdash;what if they knew?). &ldquo;But here is
Uncle Bontembi who will tell you that to be desolate of heart is
to serve evil and not true religion, since God wishes us to be happy;
for since he has created us in his image, it must be an image of
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;You reason like an angel, Demoiselle Lalette; permit that I
salute you.&rdquo; She moved just enough to make his kiss fall on her
cheek. Dame Leonalda simpered, but there was, flick and gone
again, a frown across Cleudi&rsquo;s high-cheekboned face. &ldquo;What a
lovely color your daughter has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin laid out the table with napkins which he unfolded
from the baskets. There were oysters packed in snow; bubbling
wine; a pastry of truffles and pike-livers; small artichokes pickled
entire, peaches that must have come from the south, since it was
only peach-blossom time in Dossola; white bread; a ham enriched
with spices; honeyed small sweetmeats of dwarf fruit. (If he were
only more to me and less for himself, thought Lalette, he might be
possible; for he does not stint.) They sat down with herself and her
mother opposite each other and the two men at the sides of the
table, so small that knees touched. Mathurin the servant stood beside
her chair, but flitted round to give to the rest as occasion
demanded. Cleudi discoursed&mdash;a thousand things, eating with his
left hand and letting his right now and again drop to touch the
fabric over Lalette&rsquo;s leg, which, laughing with talk and wine, she
did not deny him. (An aura, like a perfume of virility and desire
and pleasure, emanated from him; Lalette felt as though she were
swaying slightly in her seat.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette Asterhax; the name has fifteen letters,&rdquo; said Cleudi,
&ldquo;and the sum of one and five is six, which fails by one the mystical
number of seven. Look also, how you may take it by another route,
L being the twelfth letter of the alphabet, so that to it, there is
added one for A, another twelve for the second L and so on, the
sum of all being eighty-seven.&rdquo; (He has prepared this in advance,
she thought.) &ldquo;Being itself summed up again this eighty-seven is
fifteen, so it is evident that you will be incomplete and thus lacking
in happiness, until united with a man who can supply the missing
figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that the Church would approve your doctrine,&rdquo;
said Uncle Bontembi. He had moved his chair around to place his
arm over the back of Dame Leonalda&rsquo;s, and she had thrown her
head back to rest on the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are clearly wrong, my friend,&rdquo; said Cleudi. &ldquo;The Church
itself takes cognizance of the power of numbers, which are the
sign-manual of enlistment under God against evil, rather than
being the protection itself, as some ignorant persons would make
them. Look, does not the Church in Dossola have seven Episcopals?
Are there not seven varieties of angels, and is it not dulcet to
make seven prayers within the period? Whereas it is the heretical
followers of the Prophet who deny the value of numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Lalette, &ldquo;I must never complete myself by union
with you; for you have five letters and the seven of my first name
being added to them, make twelve, which is three by your manner
of computation, and an evil omen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleudi laughed. &ldquo;All, divine Lalette, your reasoning is unreason.&rdquo;
He poured more wine. &ldquo;For it is clear that man and woman are
each incomplete by themselves, not to be completed until they are
united; else we were not so formed. Now such union is manifestly
to the pleasure of God, since he arranged it thus, so that if anything
prevent true union, it must be contrary to the ordinance of
God. Is this not exact, Uncle Bontembi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through Dame Leonalda&rsquo;s giggle the priest smiled, his face
curling in wrinkles around the fat. &ldquo;Your lordship lacks only the
oath and a drop of oil in the palm to be an Episcopal. I resign in
your favor my chance of preferment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll resign no chance of preferment.&rdquo; Cleudi reached to
squeeze Lalette&rsquo;s hand, where it lay on the table. &ldquo;A stroke of
fortune. I happened to fall in with His Grace the Chancellor only
this morning. He spoke of the difficulty in finance, which is such
that&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;there is even some question whether
Her Majesty will be able to take her summer holiday in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Leonalda raised her head. &ldquo;Oh, oh, the disgrace!&rdquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see the stroke of fortune,&rdquo; said Lalette simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disgrace, yes,&rdquo; said Cleudi, his mobile face for a moment
morose. &ldquo;But I was happily able to suggest to His Grace that the
matter of taxes be placed in the hands of the lords of court, themselves
to be taxed an amount equal to that due from their seignories,
and they to collect it within their estates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again&mdash;the stroke of fortune?&rdquo; said Lalette, not much interested,
as she dipped a finger in the wine and drew arabesques on
the table-napkin in the damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Grace was so much charmed with my plan that he offered
me a place in the service, with the directorate of the lottery, so
that I now am happy enough to be no more a Tritulaccan, but
Dossolan by service of adoption.&rdquo; He lifted his glass to Lalette. &ldquo;I
shall drink to your grey eyes, and you to my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glasses touched. &ldquo;I do wish you good fortune,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better fortune could there be than to have you attend
with me the first opera-ball of the season, and make the drawing
of the lottery as its queen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Said Uncle Bontembi, in a voice as rich as though he were
addressing a congregation; &ldquo;Spring is the season most calculated
to show forth the victory of God over evil and the beginning of
new growth and happiness. Not only do we celebrate the return of
the sun, but the rejection of darkness, as the former Prince and
false Prophet.&rdquo; Lalette did not look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send a costumer to make you one of the new puffed
bodices in&mdash;yes, I think it must be red for your coloring . . .&rdquo; began
Cleudi, and then stopped, his eyes seeming to jut from their sockets,
as he stared at the wet design under Lalette&rsquo;s finger. Her own gaze
focussed, and suddenly she felt tired and very old and not wine-struck
any more, for without thinking at all she had traced the
witch-patterns her mother taught her long ago, and now they were
smoking gently on the table-cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witchery!&rdquo; croaked the Count, but recovered faster than the
shock itself, and slid in one motion to his feet, with an ironical
bow. &ldquo;Madame, my congratulations on your skill in deception,
which should take you far. You and your precious mother made me
believe you pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, witchery.&rdquo; She was up, too. &ldquo;It would have been the same
in all cases. I don&rsquo;t want your filthy costume and your filthy scudi.
Now, go!&rdquo; Before he could sign himself, she splashed him with a
spray of the dazzling drops from her fingertips. &ldquo;Go, in the name
of Trustemus and Vaton, before I bid you go in such a manner you
can never rest again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off to one side Lalette heard her mother sob; Cleudi&rsquo;s face took
on a look of dogged blankness. Without another word he let his
hands drop loose to his side, trotted to the door and through it.
Cried Uncle Bontembi; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see to her later. I must release him,&rdquo;
and rushed after, his fingers fumbling in his robe for the holy oil, his
flesh sagging in grey bags above his jowls.</p>
<p>Lalette sat down slowly, (her mind devoid of any thought save
a kind of regretful calm now she had done it), as her mother raised
a face where tears had streaked the powder. &ldquo;Oh, Lalette, how
could you&mdash;&rdquo; (the girl felt a wild flutter of being trapped again),
but both had forgotten the servant Mathurin, who stepped forward
to grip urgently at Lalette&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;Rodvard Bergelin?&rdquo; he
demanded, and she recoiled from the temper of his face, then remembered
her new-won power, and touched his hand lightly as
though to brush it away, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what business of yours if it was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is the only one can save you. The Blue Star, quickly!
Cleudi will never forgive you. He&rsquo;ll have you before the Court
of Deacons; he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; He ran round the table to Dame Leonalda.
&ldquo;Madame, where is the Blue Star? It belongs to your daughter,
and she must leave on the moment. You will not know her if
she has the torturers to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman only collapsed into a passion of alcoholic
sobbing, head on arms across the table. &ldquo;I suppose I must trust
you,&rdquo; said Lalette. &ldquo;I think I know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, you must. He is as cruel as a crocodile; would
strew your grave afterward with poems written by himself, but
not till he has the fullest pains from you. . . . Is it in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette had pulled aside her mother&rsquo;s bed, beneath which
lay the old leather portmanteau with the bar-lock. Mathurin tried
it once, twice; it would not give. Before the girl could protest,
he whipped a knife like a steel tongue from beneath his jacket
and expertly slashed around the fastening. The portmanteau fell
open on a collection of such small gauds and bits of clothing as
women treasure, Mathurin shovelling them onto the floor with
both hands until at the back he came on an old, old wooden
box, maybe a handsquare across, with a crack in the wood and
a thin slab of marble that might once have borne an inscription set
in its cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be it,&rdquo; said Lalette, &ldquo;though I have seen it only
outside the case. I cannot be certain now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witchery is needed, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your cloak and what money you have. Rodvard lives
in the Street of the Weavers, the third house on the left as you
turn in, the one with the blue door. Do not wait; I must attend
my master.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">3</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>There was a moon to throw black shadows on passing cat
and man; Lalette&rsquo;s little sharp heels clicked so loud on the
pave that she almost changed to tiptoe. The Street of the
Weavers was known to her; at its gate she had first met Rodvard,
amid booths gay with bunting for the autumn festival. He
slapped her with a bladder then, and challenged her to dance
the volalelle among the reeling violins and sweet recorders . . .</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fair lady,&rdquo; said a tentative voice. Not even looking round,
she pulled the hood closer and hurried her steps until those
behind her sounded irresolute and then died away.</p>
<p>One, two, three; moonlight showed a door that would be
a worn blue by day, clearly a pensionnario. Lalette caught her
breath at the loud flat rap of the knocker through the silent
street, held it for a long minute and was just wondering whether
she dared strike again, when there was a sound of fuzzy disturbance
within, and a wicket window beside the door came
open on an ill-tempered face, with a long, drooping, dirty
moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I must speak with Rodvard Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a respectable house. Speak with him in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;a matter of life and death&mdash;Oh, dear God!&rdquo; as the
wicket began to close. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She reached in her purse and
recklessly thrust at the face one of the three silver spadas that
were all the money she had in the world (What will mother do
tomorrow morning?). The face expressed a sour satisfaction; an
inarticulate grumble came out of it, which she interpreted as a
command to wait where she was. (The musicians&rsquo; booth had
been where the shadow of a turret split the corner in particular
shapes.)</p>
<p>A sound of footsteps approached the door from within and
it opened upon Rodvard yawning, hair awry, hose wrinkled at
the knees, jacket flung around unlaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette! What is it? Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moustached face hung itself in the background. &ldquo;She
cannot come in this house at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parlor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say she cannot come in so late. This is a respectable house.
Go down to Losleib Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Face closed the door; Rodvard, all anxious, came down the
single step, pulling his jacket together (with the fine brown hair
curling on his chest in the form of a many-pointed star). &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you help me? I do not want to be a burden, but there
is trouble. Truly, not meaning to, I set a witchery on Count
Cleudi, and they said he would have me arrested to the Court
of Deacons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was all wideawake and grave at once. &ldquo;Is there no legalist
or priest you could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stamped. &ldquo;Would I come here, to your respectable house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean&mdash;I only asked&mdash;forgive, this is to be thought
on. . . . Attention; I have heard of an inn by the north gate
where provosts never find anyone who pays. I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hardly any money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in that uncandid light, she saw his face frown and
alter, almost as Cleudi&rsquo;s had, another resemblance. (That is what
he imagines I am like, the quick thought crossed her mind,
bitterer than the doorman&rsquo;s suspicion.) &ldquo;Wait; I think I know
where you&rsquo;ll be safe for tonight, with a friend of mine who is
no friend of provosts or court lords, either. But I must get my
cap and knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was quick enough dodging his kiss to make it seem she
was only missing the intention. He went round on his heel and
up the stair, back in a minute with the feathered cap he had
worn that afternoon, and properly belted with his knife. &ldquo;This
friend of mine is a Dr. Remigorius, have you heard of him? A
great man to roar at you like a lion, but of good and generous
heart. For the poor he has always a kind word, and often physics
them or delivers their children without ever asking payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed into the night city. &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; questioned
he at a turning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning an accident&mdash;ah, do not ask me.&rdquo; She
gestured impatient, then put the hand that did not hold his
arm up to her face. &ldquo;And now I am a witch, and I swore I never
would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my fault. I am sorry. Will you wed with me?&rdquo; (The
words were out; he felt a thrill of peril run up his spine.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish&mdash;no you do not, I know it. Beside, how would
we find a priest who&rsquo;d make a marriage without episcopal
license&mdash;and for a witch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do truly desire it. I swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, spare me your false oaths. Since you ask forgiveness,
I&rsquo;ll forgive anything but those.&rdquo; She gripped his arm suddenly
so hard it hurt. At the corner of the next street was a watch of
two, one with halberd and helmet, the other sword and lantern,
but the sight of late-walking couples would be less than novel
to them, they only gave a glance in passing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Rodvard brought her round another corner and before one
of those houses built with jutting overstoreys in the Zigraner
fashion. Small-paned windows were beside a door, where a stiff
stuffed lizard hung to show that someone within practiced the
art medic. The bell tinkled crackedly; Rodvard&rsquo;s arm came
nervous-tight around the girl. &ldquo;It will turn to a happy issue,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;No harm can touch us, now we have&mdash;found each other.&rdquo;
She did not try to draw from the warm sweet pressure, and it
endured until a second ring brought the man out, with a fine
beard ridiculously done up in a sleeping-bag to hold its shape,
and a robe like a priest&rsquo;s hastily corded round him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Demoiselle Asterhax,&rdquo; said Rodvard. &ldquo;Can you
help her? She has put a witchery on one of the court lords,
Count Cleudi, and is searched for by the provosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleep fell from the older man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;A witchery? The
Tritulaccan count? He has enough favor to be deadly if he will,
and it would involve me in the overthrow. . . . But I am sworn
by the practice of the healing art to refuse help to none who
come in distress. Enter from the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette caught a darkling glimpse of shelves lined with jars
in glass or stone as they passed through. Rodvard half stumbled
against a stool and they were at an inner door, where Dr.
Remigorius said; &ldquo;Halt,&rdquo; struck flint and steel to a candle and
stood in its light beside the untidy bed, pulling off his beard-bag.
&ldquo;Now you shall tell me a true tale of how this came about,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;for a physician must know the whole nature of the
disease he is to cure, ha, ha. Will the demoiselle sit?&rdquo; He swept
the pile of his own garments from the only chair to the bed.</p>
<p>The wine in her limbs and the long double walk had left
Lalette tired and safe and not caring very much now. She sat
down slowly. &ldquo;It was only that Count Cleudi came with some
baskets of supper and was trying to persuade me to go to the
opera-ball with him, and I was toying with my fingers in some
spilled wine on the table. You know how one does&mdash;&rdquo; she made
a little gesture of appeal. &ldquo;I accidentally drew witch patterns
and when he saw what they were, he&mdash;he&mdash;he would have had
me against my will, so I witched him. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a line changed in Remigorius&rsquo; face. Said he; &ldquo;I see&mdash;all but
one detail. What made you flee so fast by midnight to my friend
Rodvard? What do you know about this Count Cleudi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his servant, a man named Mathurin, said I must instantly
take my mother&rsquo;s Blue Star and go. Because he would have had
me killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw Rodvard flick up his eyebrows as he glanced at Remigorius.
(The expression round his mouth might have been triumph,
which was incomprehensible); her brow knit, but the doctor&rsquo;s voice
was smooth as ice; &ldquo;It is not your mother&rsquo;s Blue Star, but your man&rsquo;s,
while he is your lover, and I think this must be the case, or you
would not have witched this southern Count. You have Ser Rodvard&rsquo;s
bauble safe, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>(A faint perfume of suspicion&mdash;was it to herself or to this Blue
Star that he was offering kindness?) Lalette said; &ldquo;I have it here,&rdquo;
and took the box from under her cloak.</p>
<p>The doctor, gravely; &ldquo;Then you will have the provosts much the
hotter on your trail, since the lords temporal and spiritual are not
desirous to have these things in hands they are not certain of. I think
you must fly from the city as fast as you can, perhaps even beyond
the Queen&rsquo;s writ, up to Kjermanash. Not Mayern, because of the
Prince and his prophecies. But before that it would be well to provide
this Blue Star with the needed witchery and let Ser Rodvard
bear it. When you are not easily found, be sure they will set spies
out for you, and with this tool you may be sure of people you meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette frowned, but looked at Rodvard. &ldquo;Is this your word also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be other? I think we may need the protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She lifted one palm to her forehead. &ldquo;This witching
is, I think, something that leaves one without force or will, and I
have performed one tonight. But I will do it. I would be private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the shop. Do you require materials, demoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little water&mdash;though wine would be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remigorius produced a bottle half-filled with wine from a tall
cabinet against the wall, lighted a candle-stub, and swung the shop-door
open with a bow. When it had closed behind her, Rodvard
said; &ldquo;I do not see how, if she is to be taken instantly from the city,
I can use this Blue Star for our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor glanced sidelong and whipped a finger to his lips.
&ldquo;Tish! Matter for the High Center. But who said you would go with
her?&rdquo; They were quiet; a small sound, like the mewing of a kitten,
came from the shop, then it stopped, and Lalette came back in. The
hood was on her shoulders, and her face was white to the hair-roots;
the wooden case stood open in her hand, and in it, lying on a bed of
white silk so old it had faded to yellow, the Blue Star, the witch-stone,
smaller than might have been imagined, barely a finger-joint
across, but seeming to have depth, so that even in the candlelight
all the sapphirean fires of ocean and cold hell were in its heart.</p>
<p>Rodvard shivered slightly. Lalette said; &ldquo;Open your jacket,&rdquo; and
when he had done so, hung the jewel round his neck on its thin gold
chain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will tell you as I have been taught,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that while
you wear this jewel, you are of the witch-families, and can read the
thoughts of those in whose eyes you look keenly. But only while you
are my man and lover, for this power is yours through me. If you
are unfaithful to me, it will become for you only a piece of glass;
and if you do not give it up at once when I ask it back, there will lie
upon you and it a deadly witchery, so that you can never rest
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came forward to take his face in both hands and kiss him on
the lips. The stone lay like a piece of ice against his bare chest. Rodvard
felt no different, unchanged, but as he looked deep into the
girl&rsquo;s eyes before him, he knew without words but beyond any doubt
that a black shadow had closed round her mind, she would never
witch him, she had decided, but was hating all this and Remigorius
and him too, for the moment. He turned his head, the thought
flashed away, and the doctor said, with a twist at the corner of
his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will see if this star is a true marvel or only another of
the bogey-tales made up by the lords of court to keep men in submission.
Look in my eyes, Ser Rodvard, and tell me what I am thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard looked. &ldquo;Why, why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not altogether understand,
but it is as though you were saying in words that you
would try on a living person whether an infusion of squill in vinegar
is useful in a stoppage of the passages.&rdquo; (It was not the complete
thought, there was a formless shadow at the back of his mind, something
about a treason.) Remigorius shook his head and turned from
the gaze with pressed lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s splendor! You are become a dangerous man, Ser Bergelin,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;or a cleverer one than I think.&rdquo; Then; &ldquo;I count the
night more than half gone, and you will need rest, having far to
travel in the morning. I leave you two my bed while I arrange for
your journey.&rdquo; He picked up his clothes and bowed himself into the
shop to dress. Rodvard and Lalette were left alone.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>She remained in the chair, with her head drooping and slightly
to one side, so he could see only the angle of cheek and chin. &ldquo;The
bed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am so weary,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s not needed. Do
you take it and let me rest here. I&rsquo;ll turn my back if you wish to
undress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The thought went tingling through his mind that after this afternoon&mdash;so
long ago, now&mdash;they needed no more be modest with each
other.) It almost reached his lips, but instead; &ldquo;No, you shall have
the bed; you need it,&rdquo; and held his hand to help her up, but she
hardly touched it, on her feet with a sweep of skirts, to take one
stumbling step to the towseled bed, where she flung herself down
in her cloak, and as he could tell from her breathing, was asleep almost
at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>He, wakeful as an owl-bird with excitement and having slept
earlier, sat in a chair with the ice-cold jewel unfamiliar around his
neck&mdash;bodily contact had not warmed it at all&mdash;half daydreaming,
half thinking. A high destiny? Not with a witch and through witchery.
All he thought revolted against that, it was cheating, if witchery
should rule, there was an end of free choice where choice meant
most, all hopes were then fled. There&rsquo;s no new day if this rules, we
may as well make our beds under the old Queen&rsquo;s rule, and that of
Florestan, the Laughing Chancellor.</p>
<p>Remigorius. The doctor would say this was not what he thought,
but what he had been taught; they had quarrelled on this issue before,
and Remigorius would say how Rodvard&rsquo;s reasoning led
straight as a line to the support of all the things that both desired to
throw down; how it was precisely the rejection of witchcraft as
devilish and unclean that Episcopals and Queen stood for. If there
were a good God, as the Church said, He could not allow a free
choice that might be turned against Himself and so deprive Him
of godhead.</p>
<p>Mathurin would chime in at this point to say that no man under
tyranny would by free choice choose freedom, the generality preferring
rather to have a chance of rising to the tyrant&rsquo;s seat. They must
be compelled to take the better way to their own betterment, so
that even in the secular affair free choice was a dream&mdash;and then
he, Rodvard, would be overborne by the whirl and rush of their
arguments.</p>
<p>A high destiny? Let us, Sons of the New Day, compel them,
then; ride the stormwind to greatness by setting men free. Oh, it
would be noble to be acclaimed as one of those who had brought
about the change. But no; no; that honor would go to those of the
High Center, the leaders now hidden in shadow, whose forms would
stand forth in granite with the dawning of the New Day&mdash;while the
name of Rodvard Bergelin was never heard.</p>
<p>A high destiny? He thought of battle, the close combat where
steel bows flung their sharp messengers against the double-locked
shields and horsemen went past, while the trumpets shouted. The
war-tune rang through his head&mdash;&ldquo;Lift the star of old Dossola, brave
men rise and tyrants stare . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>No. The star would never rise in this time. Dossola, defeated and
dead to honor, bound down by treaties which Queen and Florestan
upheld merely to keep their own place. Shame&mdash;no high destiny
could come from serving such a cause. For so much, what could
Rodvard Bergelin do in war, even if the cause were better? There
had been Dagus of Gr&ouml;densteg, to be sure, the archer, the great hero
who sprang from night and nowhere when Zigraners were a terror
to the land&mdash;Rodvard thought of his statue in the Long Square, one
arm aloft to hold the deadly bow, the star-badge in his cap. But that
was in the far-off glorious times, when one could clap on a hat and
run forth to adventure instead of a day&rsquo;s toil over yellow documents
at the Office of Pedigree. What could one do in this modern war,
where noble birth and twenty years of service were needed to make
a commander? He&rsquo;d lay some captain&rsquo;s bed, no doubt, and clean
his tent; or enter for a ten-year man, learn the halberd, how to shoot
the bow and form square&mdash;a dull depressing life, with a cold lone
grave at the end of it; &ldquo;stupid as a spearman&rdquo; said the proverb, and
all he had known were stupid enough. No; no destiny. &ldquo;The destiny
of all is to service, for only so can happiness be won.&rdquo; Who had said
that? Some priest; member of what Mathurin called the conspiracy
against poverty. Yet if it were not true, one must save one&rsquo;s services
for oneself and be false as hell to all the world beside. Let conscience
die . . . and dawn began to poke behind the gray window at
the sound of the doctor&rsquo;s entry returning.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">4</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DAYLIGHT; REFUGE</span></h2>
<p>Lalette sat up sleepily and sipped a little wine; there was nothing
to eat but the end of a loaf, most of which Rodvard devoured,
surprised to find that he was hungry, (and a tingle running down his
veins as he thought of the evening under the cedars). Remigorius
did not even wait for the end of the meager breakfast before breaking
out with; &ldquo;Hark, the provosts are already forth. This must be
hurried, and you two must leave. I have arranged matters to the
least peril. There&rsquo;s an inn on King Crotinianus&rsquo; Square, at the north
end, called the Sign of the Limping Cat, where the north-going
coaches halt to pick up travellers from that side of the city. Go
there; you can wait on the bench outside and had better, to avoid
talking with someone who might be a spy. I trust you, demoiselle,
to keep your face as much covered as possible; Rodvard, you shall
use that devil-stone to know the purpose of any who approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a blue-painted coach which goes to Bregatz by
way of Trandit and Liazabon. The driver&rsquo;s name is Morsens; inquire.
Before Trandit you should make an argument for the benefit
of others in the coach, you being a young couple just wed, so joyous
in the bridal that the new dame&rsquo;s trunk has been forgot. At Trandit,
then, Ser Rodvard will descend to return for it, while Demoiselle
Asterhax rides on to Bregatz in the care of Morsens the coachman
and reaches those of the Center there. Are you players enough to
play these parts? . . . It will thus not be strange when Morsens protects
her, which he will gladly do. But you must give him a gold
scuderius, for he is not one of ours, and his danger is very great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette, who had begun to take down her hair with fingers swift
and sure in order to do it up into the bridal braids, stopped with
pursed mouth. &ldquo;But I do not have a scuderius,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have
hardly any money at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of furious indignation held the doctor&rsquo;s face as it
turned toward Rodvard. &ldquo;You?&rdquo; But the young man, flushing, reached
in his jacket-pocket for a handful of coppers and one single silver
spada. &ldquo;Perhaps we can make it up together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are so
deep in arrears of pay at the office where I&rsquo;m employed . . . or if
we can find a Zigraner with his shop open early, I might pledge my
wage . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or if we find a kind-hearted provost with scudi instead of bilboes
for those he pursues!&rdquo; cried Remigorius. &ldquo;Madam, you will
need all the witchcraft you can muster, for you are surely the most
improvident fool that ever tried an evasion with what did not belong
to her. I&rsquo;ve no money, either.&rdquo; He tugged at his beard, looking at
her from anger-filled eyes, but before Lalette could more than begin
the sound of a hot retort, changed expression, shrugged, and spread
his hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a night&rsquo;s work gone glimmering, then. But I&rsquo;ll not send
you back to Cleudi and the Deacons&rsquo; Court, even though you were
other than friend Rodvard&rsquo;s mistress.&rdquo; He mused (and Rodvard,
catching his eye as the head turned, saw in it a flash of deadly acquisitiveness
for the Blue Star, no real interest in Lalette&rsquo;s fate
whatever). The young man started as from a blow; Remigorius spoke
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must hide in the city, then, till somehow transport&rsquo;s found.
Would be welcome to this abode, but too many come here for
physic; the matter would be bruited about. Nor your place, neither,
Rodvard. The Queen&rsquo;s provosts will not be long in finding your connection
with this demoiselle, no. Your mother know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Said Lalette; &ldquo;If you mean of Rodvard, I&mdash;I do not think so. We
met always while she was at the Service. He never came to the
house and there was only my gossip, Avilda Brekoff, who was ever
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may have a few days before they come on the scent.
Were you seen coming here last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by a watch of two from a distance, and by the doorman
where I live,&rdquo; said Rodvard, but Lalette; &ldquo;I had to give the man a
silver spada to call Rodvard and there was some slight bargle over
whether I might enter. I fear I was not only seen, but noted. I regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well. Here&rsquo;s the few days lost again. If the matter&rsquo;s
pressed, they will surely question the doorman of every pensionnario
in the city.&rdquo; Remigorius swung knit brows to Rodvard; &ldquo;You
had best go to your working place today, for the absence might be
noted. But I will let you return to your pensionnario for only the
once, and then to bring away nothing but your most intimate needs.
Stop for no meal, where there&rsquo;s talk&mdash;at least, till we can be sure of
this doorman. What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Krept or something like it, I do not know for sure. We call him
Udo the crab. I have one or two books I would not willingly lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you rather lose your life?&rdquo; The doctor scrabbled for a
piece of paper and began to write. &ldquo;This is more dreadful than you
know of. Demoiselle, you can be secure for a little time with a
friend of ours, a certain Mme. Kaja, who used to be a singer in the
opera. She lives on the top floor of an old goat&rsquo;s nest in the Street
Cossao and has young girls visiting her all the time for instruction
in music, so there&rsquo;ll be no comment at your appearance.&rdquo; His pen
scratched, he stood up, threw sand on the paper and let it slide to
the floor. &ldquo;This be your passport. Your lover&mdash;&rdquo; (the word was accompanied
by a lip-turn that made Lalette shiver) &ldquo;&mdash;can join you
there this twilight. But wait&mdash;you may be known in the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bustled into the shop-room and returned with a pair of
quills. &ldquo;Up your nose, one on either side. So. I&rsquo;d like it better if
there were another cloak for you, but leave the hood of this one
down; with your hair changed, and your face . . .&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It would be the morning after his wedding breakfast on new
wine and old bread with fear for a sauce, that <i>she</i> should come to
the Office of Pedigree again&mdash;with her bands of light hair, fine chin
line and cheekbones, and the pointed coronet badge in her hat that
showed her a baron&rsquo;s daughter. All morning Rodvard had been
dozing and drowsing; she greeted him gaily; &ldquo;Have you found more
of this matter with which the stem of Stojenrosek is to confound
Count Cleudi, or has the weather been too fine for work indoors?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, demoiselle.&rdquo; (There was a twist in his chest, he could barely
get the words out.) He passed the chair where she showed a turn
of ankle, to one of the tall dark wall-files, and took out a parchment.
&ldquo;One of the recorders lighted on this&mdash;see, it is from the reign of
King Crotinianus the Second, the great king, and bears his seal of
the boar&rsquo;s head, with that of his Chancellor. It is a series of decisions
on inheritance and guardianship for the province of Zenss. At the
eleventh year of the reign there is one here&mdash;&rdquo; he handled the pages
over carefully &ldquo;&mdash;giving the son of Stojenrosek leave to wed with
one Luedecia and pass the inheritance to their daughters, though
she&rsquo;s but a bowman&rsquo;s daughter herself, there being no heiresses female
to take the estate, which would thus have fallen to the
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had stood up to look at the old crabbed chancery hand of
the document where he spread it on the table and her shoulder
brushed his. Said she; &ldquo;Did they wed, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, demoiselle, I cannot tell you.&rdquo; (Shoulder did not withdraw.)
&ldquo;So many of the records of that time were destroyed in the
great fire at Zenss a quadrial of years ago. But I will search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so . . . I cannot read it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What does this say?&rdquo; Her
fingers touched his in a small shock, where they were outspread to
hold the parchment, and the contact rested as she bent to look, in
the spring light filtering through the dusty panes. The inner door
to the cabinet adjoining was closed; down the corridor outside,
someone was whistling as he walked, she turned her head to face
him slowly, he felt the witch-stone cold as ice over his heart, and to
shut out what he feared was coming, Rodvard croaked chokingly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Maritzl.&rdquo; (No use; it came over sharply&mdash;if he kiss
me, I will not stay him, I will marry him, I will take him into my
father&rsquo;s house, I will even be his mistress if he demands it . . . this
disappearing in the lightning-flash of Lalette saying, &ldquo;If you are ever
unfaithful&mdash;&rdquo; and flash on flash what would happen if he lost the
Blue Star for which he had sacrificed so much. Sold, sold.)</p>
<p>She caught her breath a little. He disengaged the parchment
from her hand. &ldquo;I will have it copied for you in a modern hand,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Under Remigorius&rsquo; order, Rodvard did not go home to the pensionnario
at sun-turning as usual, but took his repast for a pair of
coppers on small beer and cheese at a tavern near his labor. He had
been there not often, but it seemed to him that the place bubbled
with talk beyond custom, and he wondered if the cause were some
tale of Count Cleudi&rsquo;s witching and Lalette&rsquo;s escape, a speculation
dispelled on his return, for there came to him young Asper Polt&eacute;n
from the next cabinet with:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that girl you squired to the harvest festival turned
out to be a witch? She has witched Count Cleudi, and stolen all his
money; they say he&rsquo;s going to die. They have closed the city gates
and set a price on her. Your fortune that you carried matters no further
with one like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard shuffled papers. Some reply was necessary. &ldquo;Why are
they so urgent over a foreigner? People have been witched before
without having all the paving stones in Netznegon City torn up
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you forever live in dreams? He&rsquo;s the new favorite&mdash;named
director of the lottery only yesterday. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason the
witch rode him&mdash;for jealousy more than the scudi. She&rsquo;s not to be
blamed if, as I hear, he&rsquo;s more than a proper man in the parts that
matter most to women. They say Cleudi and the Florestan held an
exhibition for Her Majesty and the Tritulaccan was longer. Speaking
of which, Ser Rodvard, you are not far from fortune yourself.
I saw the Demoiselle of Stojenrosek here again today. She&rsquo;ll have
a shapelier body than Cleudi will ever press, and bring you a fortune
in addition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Did you see her indeed, curse you? and what business is it
of yours?&rdquo; Rodvard wanted to cry; or &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s the high destiny of
the witch.&rdquo;) But aloud he could only say; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in that.
She&rsquo;s only searching out some old family records. I must go to
Ser Habbermal&rsquo;s cabinet; he has a project forward for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up with a trifling stagger, leg tingling with the pain
of the position in which he had cramped it. Asper Polt&eacute;n made
offended eyes. &ldquo;Ah, plah, you are too nice for anything but priesthood!&rdquo;
He turned away, flung open the door to the next cabinet,
and could be heard uttering to the three within; &ldquo;Bergelin again;
this time pretending he does not know what women carry between
their legs or what it&rsquo;s used for&mdash;&rdquo; with a whoop of merriment
from the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>Rodvard himself, before they could all come in and begin their
usual sport of baiting, walked to the outer door, through it, and
without so much as pausing at the garderobe for his cap, straight
down the corridor to the street and away, the last steps running.
If there were stares at seeing him without headgear or mark of
condition, he did not return them, but hurried on to his own living-place.
The pensionnaria was at the foot of the stairs, the little black
hairs on her upper lip quivering as she administered some rebuke
to a maid who held a trayful of dirty dishes, but her eye lighted
as she turned to perceive a new victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too late, Ser Bergelin. If we make a rule good for one,
it must stand for all, because it is only so that I can keep up a
place like this, as cheap as it is, and I simply can&rsquo;t have you bringing
girls here late at night, I have told Udo. . . .&rdquo; The end of it he
did not hear, as he broke past her up the stairs, bounding.</p>
<p>The extra set of hose must come, of course, but his best jacket
would not go on over the other, so he had to make a bundle with
underclothing and wrap it in the cloak that it was too fine a day to
wear. The festival-cap must stay behind, even though it might
bring some coppers from a dealer; also the pair of tiny southern-made
health-goblets for carrying at the waist on feast days, of
whose acquisition he had been so proud. At the last moment he
added the volume of Dostal&rsquo;s ballads; of all the books, he could
spare that one least. There was a moment of fear when a glance
through the glass-windowed door showed callers closeted with
Udo the Crab, but side vision registered the fact that they were
only a pair of rough fellows in leather jackets, not blue-and-green
provosts.</p>
<p>He had been to Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s only once before, and then at
night, for a meeting of the Sons of the New Day. Under this
more vivid light the Street Cossao showed as a dirty courtyard
with a running sore of gutter down the center, garbages piled
in the corners, yelling children underfoot and somewhere among
the upper stories a hand that practiced the violon monotonously,
playing the harvest-song, but always going sour on the same
double-stop passage. Rodvard elected the wrong house first, the
doorman did not know of Kaja, but the next one at the back
angle of the court was it; he went up a narrow dark winding
stair smelling of yesterday&rsquo;s cabbage and knocked at the topmost
door.</p>
<p>Mme. Kaja herself answered, clad in an old dressing-gown,
pink silk, and dirty gray where it dragged along the floor, with
her hair packed untidily atop her head. Past her a space of floor
was visible, with light coming through a pair of dormer windows,
a keyed musical instrument and chairs. &ldquo;Ser Rodvard!&rdquo; she
squealed, her voice going into a high musical note. &ldquo;You are sooo
welcome. We did not expect you this early. The dear girl is
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>A door against the slant of the garret opened and Lalette came
out, unaffectedly glad it was he, and this time not avoiding as he
ran forward to kiss her on the lips. The older woman; &ldquo;I leave you
to your greetings, while I make myself beautiful.&rdquo; She passed
through the door from which Lalette had come; the girl sat
down. After the door had closed behind Kaja, &ldquo;Rodvard,&rdquo; she
said, very still and looking at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you my Blue Star. Whether to marry you now
I do not know. I think not&mdash;it seems to me that you are not
altogether willing; I feel you are holding something back from
me. But this I say, and you may look into my heart and find
it true&mdash;&rdquo; she raised her head in a blaze of grey eyes &ldquo;&mdash;that I
want to be a good partner to you, Rodvard, and will honestly do
all in my power never to fail you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the inner room came the sound of Mme. Kaja, running
scales in what was left of her voice (and what could he say?
thought Rodvard, who had won this loyalty for Remigorius&rsquo; reason
and not his own desire. Let conscience die, but not with a tear
at the heartstrings.) &ldquo;I will do as much,&rdquo; said he, and as her lip
quivered at his tone, &ldquo;if we ever pass this peril with our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted a hand and let it fall beside her. &ldquo;It is life without
account of peril that I have offered,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Lalette, look at me. Will you lie with
me this night, in peril or whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she would not meet the questioning eyes now (and he
thought, she thought, they both knew there had been somehow
a lack of communication). Lalette said; &ldquo;You have come before
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuddered slightly. &ldquo;They picked at me till I must leave.
You will hardly believe how&mdash;how base&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inner door sprang open and Mme. Kaja emerged with
almost a dance-step, dressed to the eyes in withering finery.
&ldquo;For a little while I must go forth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you will hardly
miss me, he, he. I&rsquo;ll bring sup from the cook-shop, is there a
delicacy you desire or any other way I can lighten captivity for
my two caged birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She beamed on them fondly. Rodvard thought of the cap left
at the office and prayed her for a new one, with the badge of his
condition, which took more of his slender store of coppers. The
door closed; and now they two had not much to say to each
other, having agreed that all that mattered should be left unsaid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>The end of it was that Lalette in all her clothes lay down on
the bed in the corner to make up for some of the sleep lost last
night, while he undid his parcel and set out to lose himself in
Iren Dostal&rsquo;s harmonies and tales&mdash;but that did not do very well
either, the poems he had always loved seemed suddenly pointless.
He fell into a kind of doze or waking dream, in which the
thought came to his mind that if he were really ready to let conscience
die in exchange for high destiny, he had only to give
this witch back her Blue Star, call for the provosts, and claiming
the price set on her, seek out Maritzl of Stojenrosek. A destiny
not high by the standards of the Sons of the New Day, no doubt.
But love and position, aye. Remigorius would approve; would
call it the act of a great spirit to seek an inner contentment, no
matter what others thought of how it was achieved, no matter
if others were hurt during the achievement. But Remigorius
thought the struggle more important than its end&mdash;and it might
be that the reason he, Rodvard, could see no high destiny, was
that he did not possess such a spirit, immune to scruple, willing
to serve any cause.</p>
<p>Now he fell on to wondering what was the tangle of ideas and
thoughts that made up himself, Rodvard Bergelin, where they
came from and how they were put together&mdash;could they be
altered?&mdash;and so drifted deeper into his daydream till it began
to grow dusk and Mme. Kaja came back with a covered dish
of fish and red beans.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">5</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NIGHT; GENEROSITY; TREASON</span></h2>
<p>She was less cooing than before, having learned of the closing
of the city gates and the price on Lalette. (For the first time she
knows what it is to be a conspirator, Rodvard thought.) There was
a self-sacrificing debate over where to sleep, for the singer had only
the one bed and tried to insist that the pair use it, or at least share
it with her. In the end Rodvard composed himself across a pile of
old garments on the floor. They smelled, he felt ill-used, and went to
sleep wondering rather desperately what to do about money.</p>
<p>That problem became no easier with the morning, when Mme.
Kaja said her own funds were very low and she could not receive
her pupils while the two were there. As she was going out Rodvard
gave her his last silver spada, whose breakup would keep them
nourished for a couple of days. Lalette added that she was much
concerned over her mother; could the singer obtain news?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>Hardly had the receding footsteps left the first flight when Rodvard,
burning inwardly with anxiety, suspense and the thought of
another do-nothing day, which combined to translate themselves
into desire, swung the girl off her feet in his arms and bore her
toward the bed without a word. She struggled a little and the Blue
Star told him she was not very willing, but the contact of their
bodies soon caught her, she only asked to be careful of her dress as
she pulled it off&mdash;and Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s voice said; &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard rolled over, blood running hot through his cheeks. &ldquo;I
am so-o-o sorry,&rdquo; the older woman said. &ldquo;I was going to the Service
and found I had forgot my Book of Days. But you must not mind,
really you must not, when I was in the opera, His Majesty used to
make three of us attend him together and when the heart
speaks . . .&rdquo; rattling like a broken music-box in terms that Rodvard
scarcely heard, as she crossed the room to take the Book of Days and
left again without looking at them directly.</p>
<p>Lalette (feeling as though she had bathed in a sewer and never
wanted to touch anything clean again) took her dress to put it on.
When Rodvard touched her shoulder, she shook his hand away and
said, simply; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I regret&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I am the one most to blame. It does not matter now for
any reason.&rdquo; Her mouth moved and she looked down, tieing
laces. &ldquo;Dear God, what your fine friends will think of me! I should
have accepted Count Cleudi&rsquo;s offer; at least I would have been well
paid for the name I&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt himself flush again. &ldquo;Well, if they call you any name
you do not wish to have, it will be your own fault,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
have offered you marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, indeed, with me furnishing the priest&rsquo;s spada for the
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and I will hold to the offer. Demoiselle, you are not just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and sat down, (feeling suddenly weary, bitten with
the edge of concern about her mother, so that it was not worth
while to quarrel). He made one or two beginnings of speech, but
could settle on nothing worth saying; moved about the room, clanking
the coppers in his pocket, and looked out the window; picked
at one or two keys of the music in a manner that showed he had no
training with it; found a book of Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s and standing,
skimmed a few pages, then set it down; resumed his pacing; abandoned
it; walked to where he had placed his few belongings on a
chair, took his own book and settled himself purposefully to read,
in a position where his face was mostly in shadow from her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>(The angry shame had run off Lalette now, she could only see
that he was truly unhappy.) After a little while she ran across the
room, put her arms around his shoulder and kissed the side of his
face. &ldquo;Rodvard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I really meant it all. If you want me,
you may have me any time you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung her down to his lap, but (now afraid of interruption)
would go no farther than kissing her and holding her close, so for
a long time they remained thus lip to lip, speaking a little to exchange
memories of things pleasant in their few meetings and not
noticing they had missed a meal, until they heard Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s step
outside the door, which this time she made firm enough to give
them warning. The singer began to talk at once about the Service
and how as the chanters intoned the celestial melody and the
violet vestments fluttered among the flowers that fell from the galleries
to crush fragrantly beneath the worshipers&rsquo; knees, she could
feel every power of evil roll from her mind&mdash;&ldquo;though the second
baritone was flat in the <i>musanna</i>. Oh, if only the court would have
religion in its heart, as the poor people do, who sat with tears in
their eyes.&rdquo; She smiled suddenly on Lalette:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke to my own priest, too, for you. I know you must have
a confession to make by now&mdash;&rdquo; she held up outspread fingers before
her face and tittered through them &ldquo;&mdash;so I made up a story for
you, about a jealous husband, and he will hear you after dark,
when all&rsquo;s safe, and you won&rsquo;t have to pay but a copper or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette looked up. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no confession to make. . . . Did
you find out about my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard saw Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s eyes open wide, and felt the cold
stone (she was not believing Lalette at all, and for some reason
was desperately frightened that the girl should lie). &ldquo;Oh, you
poooor child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was so unthinking of me to forget to
tell you. I did not find out much, but I know the provosts have not
taken her, and Count Cleudi is not as ill as pretended, that is only
a story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>She set down packages of food, a dish of lentils with bread and
wine; began to make ready the table, keeping her eyes averted, so
Rodvard could not read her thinking (it came to him that he would
not be the first Star-bearer she had met) as she talked rapidly,
about the Service once more. The priest had said that when anyone
admitted evil to his heart, peril lay upon all persons approaching
the lost one. &ldquo;For these powers of evil increase like mice in a granary,
running from one soul to another, and as farmers will often
burn an old grain-bin to keep the vermin from spreading, so it is
lawful and even necessary to destroy the body of one infected by
the powers of evil. He was talking about this poor child here, it
was easy to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard (to whom this was interesting, if somewhat questionable
discourse) would have inquired more as she paused for
breath, but Lalette (who found it more than tiresome) broke in
to ask what of the city? what of the hunt for her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have opened the gates again, though I did not go to
see, and put guards everywhere. But it will be all right. Have I
ever recounted to you, friend Rodvard, that I was in arrest once myself?
It was because of that Oronari, who was so jealous because
I could carry the high note in &lsquo;The Mayern Lovers&rsquo; while she could
not, and had me accused of stealing some of the jewels that were
loaned for the spring festival performance. I felt very badly about
it, because she was a friend of mine, but it&rsquo;s just as the priest said,
the power of evil had gained control over her, and there was nothing
I could do but complain to the Baron Coespel, who was my
protector then, and he had her banished the . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stuffed food into her mouth, masticating noisily as she
babbled. Rodvard caught a flash of Lalette&rsquo;s eye (and knew she
was thinking how thin the veneer of half a lifetime around the
court was over someone with a peasant&rsquo;s background). To change
things he asked; &ldquo;Madame, is there any word of the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not send the fruiterer from his street?&rdquo; She sighed and
turned to Lalette. &ldquo;Then it is likely that he has no money as yet.
He is so good and kind and works for so little that it is often so.
Dear child, have you no funds at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Lalette; &ldquo;Only two spadas. But I took all the money in the
house when I left, and my mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, of course we all love our parents and do all we
can for them, but after all, they are only our relatives by accident
and not the choice of the heart&mdash;&rdquo; she smote her breast in the gesture
Rodvard remembered &ldquo;&mdash;and when the heart speaks, God
dwells in us to drive out the powers of evil. Then we are grateful
to those who speak to us through the heart, and if we have anything
we give it to them. I denied the heart once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon,&rdquo; said Lalette, and stood up to leave the table.
Her face was a little white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Mme. Kaja finished the last of the wine and wiped her mouth. &ldquo;I
know it is hard for you, being of the witch-families, dear child,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But Uncle Tutul, who is the priest we are going to see
tonight, says that even a witch may save herself if she gives up
everything to those she loves, and oh, my dear, I really do not mind
missing my pupils, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s mouth strained. She stood up and plucked from her
waist the tiny purse. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are the spadas,&rdquo; and flung
them ringing silvernly against the plates. &ldquo;Take them; I am going
to the provosts myself. To be seduced, I will, it was my fault. But
I will owe no obligation for it.&rdquo; She turned to the door so fast that
Rodvard barely barred the way before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, as she tried to push him from the way. &ldquo;You
shall not go like this.&rdquo; Their hands caught and she struggled for
a moment. &ldquo;Or if you&rsquo;ll say you do not love and never will, go; and
I will join you before the Deacons&rsquo; court. But it was another tale
that you told lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Mme. Kaja; &ldquo;Oh, dear child, you must not resist such love.&rdquo;
She tittered (and the nerves of both the others jangled).</p>
<p>Lalette sat down. &ldquo;I am at the mercy of you two,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy? Mercy?&rdquo; The singer&rsquo;s bracelets clanked. &ldquo;Ah, no, we are
at yours, and seek to help you at our own risk. Not so, friend Rodvard?&rdquo;
She swung to face him for an unguarded moment (and he
was staggered till he must grip the table-edge at the blast of hate
for Lalette behind her eyes. There was a strange mother-thought
in it too, he could not make out the detail.) Kaja&rsquo;s glance went
restlessly on across the room. She stood up in her turn, saving; &ldquo;I
do not know the hour, my watch is being repaired, but I am sure
by the dimness outside it must be late, and Uncle Tutul is waiting.
Demoiselle Asterhax&mdash;no, I shall call you Lalette, it is so much more
friendly&mdash;will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Rodvard thought; if I let her go, everything will arrange itself
to my utmost advantage.) &ldquo;Maritzl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not go out this
evening. There&rsquo;s no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. Kaja tittered once more. &ldquo;Ah, friend Rodvard,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d have women kind to you, you must remember their names.
Will you come, Demoiselle Lalette? Even if there&rsquo;s no confession,
it will be a joy to hear Uncle Tutul&rsquo;s discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard; &ldquo;Lalette, I beg you, by all you have said this day and
all we hope for in the future, do not go out now. I have a reason.&rdquo;
He reached one hand and took hers, as she looked at him (wondering
why he was so vehement in such a small matter); a child&rsquo;s look,
with trust in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; and she sat down again. A glassy smile appeared
on Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s face, and she shook one finger at Lalette as she
hurried to the door. &ldquo;You naughty Rodvard; she will certainly have
a confession to make before I return,&rdquo; and her steps were audible,
going down.</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s hands lay listless in her lap. For a minute there was
silence, in which she rose, walking slowly to the window to gaze
out and down, not turning around. &ldquo;What is your reason and who
is Maritzl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had begun to make up his bundle with quick fingers, the
volume of Iren Dostal inside. &ldquo;We must leave here forthwith. The
Blue Star&mdash;she will do you a terrible harm if she can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told me nothing I did not know without that bit of
witchery. A pattern would be useless against her, though, she is too
close to the Church. . . . Rodvard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo; He pulled the edge of the cloak tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I said what lately I did . . . about being seduced.
Will you forgive? I do not wish to be a shrew, as my mother said,
and I will say that I do not regret&mdash;what we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped the knot half-made and ran over to her, but she
shifted in his grasp, pointing. &ldquo;Rodvard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the line of her finger he saw hurrying figures pass the
lantern at the gate of the Street Cossao. Impossible to miss Mme.
Kaja or the priest, or the provost with bare alerted sword. Said
Rodvard; &ldquo;I did not think her so quick in her grimness. Is there
another stair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know. I am sure not. No escape. Oh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cannot be true. Life is to those who struggle for it, says
Dr. Remigorius.&rdquo; He threw the latch and pushed the window outward;
not a foot down lay a broad rain-gutter, which being proved
solid by foot-weight test, he went three rapid steps across the
room to sling his bundle over one shoulder, stepped out cautiously,
caught a grip at the edge of the dormer with his right hand (not
daring to look down into the dizzy dark), and stretched the other to
Lalette. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could feel her shiver dreadfully as she took the step, she
almost tripped over her dress on the sill, but once out, it was she
who stretched to the limit of his restraining hand to swing the
window closed. By good fortune it was a suave spring night; Rodvard
could see stars past the rim of the house as they edged rightward,
free hands pressed against the slates of the mansard, until
contact was made with the second dormer, the one in the dressing
room. He gripped at that edge, sliding foot against foot, the bundle
almost pulling him off balance where he came against the projection.
&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; whispered Lalette. &ldquo;I can hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Ahead and beyond the roof turned; one might work round that
backslope but it would only lead to the opposite side of Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s
garret. Rodvard halted his sliding progress and looked over his
shoulder to see the loom of the house at the back of the court, fortunately
of the same height. A glance down showed another gutter,
with something more than a thigh-length of black space in separation.
He turned again, face brushing slates, to make out that Lalette
had seen it, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try it?&rdquo; he whispered, and then, incontinently, &ldquo;I
love you&rdquo; (which was for that enchanted moment true). For answer
she disengaged her hand from his and began to tuck up her skirt,
leaning with cheek against the roofslope. He swung and tossed the
bundle to the other gutter; set foot on the edge where they were,
teetered, and with perspiring palms, pushed himself into the long
step, almost going down when the lip of the opposite gutter proved
higher. But it was wider as well, it held, he was able to reach a
hand out and pull her across.</p>
<p>There were no windows on this side of the other house, they
found it easy to slide along leftward to the corner, and by the
especial grace of heaven, there was a drain at the angle, in which
Rodvard&rsquo;s foot caught to keep them from tumbling where the
gutter ended suddenly, with the back of the building going down
sheer. They both stood breathless as a window in the building they
had just left cracked open, a voice said; &ldquo;No, not along the gutter
there. Perhaps they jumped.&rdquo; Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s titter was raised. &ldquo;We
must get more men and search&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette pressed Rodvard&rsquo;s hand; the window closed, and they
stood mute on the roof-edge, finger laced in finger, for it seemed a
long time. From below in the court, voices floated up, clear as
though they were only a few feet away, except that one could not
make out words, only that Kaja&rsquo;s tone was among the rest. Lalette
drew him to her and whispered; &ldquo;We must go back through before
she returns,&rdquo; and began to lead to where they had crossed the gap.
She was clearly right, they had no future there, the roof where
they were had no break, was only the side of the building, which
went to its peak at the front as well as the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>The return, with its repetition of peril already overcome, was
worse than the passage. Rodvard had to stand on the very edge of
the gutter to swing back. Lalette followed lightly. By the time he
had reached the window of the dressing-room, worked it open with
one hand, and had a leg across the sill, he dared look down&mdash;and
saw what might have made them earlier hesitate about making a
return, namely a blue provost standing watchfully under the lamp
at the street entrance, while two or three figures more were moving
about. But like most searchers, they never looked aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; whispered Lalette as they stood in the room, and he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dare not leave the building now. Even if they were not
below, the doorman will be awake. Have you seen anyone else
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must try at random whether it is true, as the priests
say, that not all men are evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing the outer room, hand in hand in the dark, Rodvard
stumbled against a chair, swore softly, and they both laughed under
breath. A board creaked, so did the hinges of the outer door, and
they were going down, each in turn tripping a little at the short
end of the steps where the stairway turned. By unspoken mutual
agreement, they tiptoed past the door of the outer apartment of the
fifth and to that at the rear of the house. Rodvard gathered his
breath and knocked.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">6</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NIGHT AND DAY; THE PLACE OF MASKS</span></h2>
<p>No step sounded, but as they stood close to catch any stir, a
clear, childish treble came muffled through the wood:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard squeezed Lalette&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I cannot tell you from
here,&rdquo; she said with her mouth close to the door, &ldquo;but we need
help. Will you let us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pause, in which a chain rattled. &ldquo;In the name and protection
of the God of Love, enter,&rdquo; and the door melted before them into
a darkness different because it held shapes. &ldquo;Stand there till I
make a light,&rdquo; said the young voice. &ldquo;You must be careful not
to break things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>There was a small sound of fumbling, flint and steel clicked
and the candle came slowly into light on a scene that made
Rodvard and Lalette both almost cry out, for the small room
seemed crowded with people; princes and queens with coronets,
richly and gaily dressed, beggars in rags of silk, yellow warriors
with ram-horn helmets, Zigraners with want-chins and sliding
eyes and all other fantasies of human shape, so life-like in the
uncertain gleam that it was an eye-flick before they could be
recognized as festival masquerades. In the midst of them a smooth-haired
boy of it might be anywhere from twelve to sixteen stood
bowing gravely in his night-hose, candle held at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My name is Laduis Domijaiek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a good name for them, from the northwestern provinces,
where Queen and Florestan were least popular. Said
Rodvard; &ldquo;We are pursued by the city provosts because a court
lord wishes harm to this lady. Will you help her get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at Lalette, cocking his head on one side, as
though listening to a distant voice. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My heart says
it is right and we must always listen to the heart. Besides, we
don&rsquo;t like the provosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lalette. &ldquo;Where are your parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father is in another world, and mother&rsquo;s at the Marquis of
Palm&rsquo;s palace to make the costumes for the spring festival. She&rsquo;s
going to stay all night and she told me I must go to bed. But
this is more fun.&rdquo; He looked at Lalette again, and his eyes
widened suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, are you the witch? Witch something
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her situation, Lalette smiled. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid
it would hurt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We are Amorosians, and so witches can&rsquo;t hurt anything
but our outsides. I&rsquo;m not supposed to tell anybody that,
only the provosts are after you, too, so it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From outside came the sound of feet, tramp, tramp, on the
stair, and distant voices. &ldquo;They are going to search,&rdquo; said Rodvard.
&ldquo;Laduis, the lady will come back and witch something for you
another day, but just now we must get her away from the
provosts. Is there any way out of this house except by the
main stair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was all seriousness. &ldquo;Not from this floor, Ser. I used
to go down the drain-pipe from Ser Tetteran&rsquo;s quarter, but that
was when I was thirteen and it isn&rsquo;t dignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must hide her.&rdquo; Rodvard&rsquo;s eye darted round the
small room, took in the door to that still smaller, where beds
must be. &ldquo;The masks; can you help us into some of these?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Laduis Domijaiek clapped his hands, and they set to work&mdash;for
Lalette a Kjermanash princess, whose billowing imitation furs
would hide the trimness of her figure; a hunchback Zigraner
moneylender for Rodvard, with a bag of brass-plated scudi. Her
dress had to come off, but the boy took it to hang with his
mother&rsquo;s and came back to help Rodvard adjust the face-mask
as furniture was moved overhead. The thumping came to an end,
there was the sound of feet on the stairs once more, Rodvard and
Lalette squeezed past the ghostly figures at the front of the
assembled masks, and the boy blew out the candle.</p>
<p>Bang! &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s warrant!&rdquo; said a voice outside. &ldquo;Open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard could hear the boy&rsquo;s feet go pad, pad, on the floor
from the bedroom, acting his part in all detail. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s warrant; we&rsquo;re looking for an assassin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chain rattled. Through the eye-peeps of the mask, Rodvard
could see the priest in the light of the provost&rsquo;s lantern, and
held his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need her. Stand aside.&rdquo; Rodvard stood rigid, cursing
himself for a fool to have put on this Zigraner guise with its
bag of false coins that might jingle. &ldquo;By the Service, the whole
assembly&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; The priest held high his amulet; this was the
moment of test, but it passed so lightly there might have been
no test at all. The provost raised his lantern; &ldquo;Anybody call on
you tonight, sprout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asleep, ser provost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grunted, light flickered as he went into the bedroom,
there was a thud as though he might be kicking something, and
he came back into the sweep of sight, a naked shortsword
showing in his hand. &ldquo;Not there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah, bah, she&rsquo;s a
witch and has spirited herself to the Green Islands. But I&rsquo;ll
have my revenge.&rdquo; He swung his sword at the neck of a yellow-armored
Mayern fighting man, and Rodvard heard the head crack
to the floor as the boy cried; &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; The provost; &ldquo;Three
scudi reward for a foeman down. Tell your mother I saved you
from a villain. Hark, now; open your door this night to none
more; an order in Her Majesty&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door banged to leave it dark for those within and feet
retreated beyond. Rodvard stirred cramped muscles. &ldquo;Will they
come back?&rdquo; Lalette&rsquo;s voice whispered.</p>
<p>The candle lifted slowly into light. Laduis Domijaiek was on
one knee beside the fallen head, whose nose was broken off.
The eyes that looked up held tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man killed Baron Mondaifer,&rdquo; he said, fiercely, &ldquo;and I
would like to kill him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Lalette slipped off her head-mask and ran a hand across her
hair, looking very princess with her dark head against the white
Kjermanash fur. &ldquo;A true sorrow and it is our fault,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you have names for them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. You are the Princess Sunimaa, and she&rsquo;s always
getting into trouble because it&rsquo;s cold where she comes from, and
her heart is all ice, and the others don&rsquo;t like her except for
Bonsteg the beggar, who is really a prince in disguise, only she
doesn&rsquo;t know it yet. But Baron Mondaifer was one of my favorites.
He&rsquo;s from Mayern, you see, and he&rsquo;s always lived in the
forest, even if he is in favor of Prince Pavinius, and thinks he&rsquo;s
still a good prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard, undoing laces to get out of his Zigraner dress;
&ldquo;Your mother will get someone to fix him and bring him back
to life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. His spirit&rsquo;s gone away to another body, like father&rsquo;s
and now there isn&rsquo;t anything left but dust. If mother has a
new head made, I shall have to give it a different name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at Rodvard solemnly, and though the Blue
Star was cold as cold upon his breast, he could not somehow
draw quite clear the thought behind those young candid eyes&mdash;something
about a place shrouded in clouds, an old house somewhere,
with a diffused golden light. Weariness slit his jaws into
a yawn. &ldquo;There is a place where we can sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>They had to take his mother&rsquo;s bed, not meant for more than
one, so that for the first time they lay close wrapped in each
other&rsquo;s arms with a night before them; and this, with the sharp
memory of the peril shared on the rooftops hand in hand, was a
little more than either could quite bear unmoved, even though
the boy was in a corner of the room. They began kissing and
holding each other very tight; presently deep breaths said Laduis
was asleep. She did not resist (nor desire to). Afterward, Rodvard
lay for a long time wakeful (thinking that this had been the
sobbing, true union, not an arranged accident like that under the
tree; they had pledged each other and were somehow one forever.
Now he was committed, and there was a deep harsh sweetness
in the thought of devotion and change, live and love, forgetting
all ambition, high destiny and even the Sons of the New
Day that had brought him to this.)</p>
<p>Of course lark and Laduis rose before them in the morn; the
first the pair heard was a double rap at the outer door and the
boy&rsquo;s voice saying; &ldquo;Mother, we have guests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Rodvard rolled out to make the best bow he could with half
his laces still undone, and saw a small woman of careworn
aspect and maybe thirty-five years, who had just set a heavy
basket on the floor. &ldquo;Madame Domijaiek, I am your humble
servant, Rodvard Bergelin. Your son took my&mdash;sweetheart and
myself in last night to save us from distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I listened to the voice of the heart, as you said,&rdquo;
piped the boy. &ldquo;They are good. Besides a provost came and broke
Baron Mondaifer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well done, son.&rdquo; She placed a hand protectingly on his
shoulder. &ldquo;Ser, I am glad that Laduis could help you. Have
you breakfasted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left some of my bread and cheese for them, mother. The
lady is a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard saw the woman&rsquo;s face alter, and her eyes, which
had held only a mild questioning, were taken away from him.
She fumbled in her belt-purse. &ldquo;Laduis,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you get
another piotr-weight of millet from the shop at the market-square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette came from the bedroom, looking only by the half as
delightful as Rodvard&rsquo;s night memory painted her; curtsied and
said straightly; &ldquo;Madame, I am in your benevolence and honor,
so now no concealments. I am Lalette Asterhax, the veritable
witch on whom the provosts have set a price, and if my being
here will trouble you, I&rsquo;ll leave on the instant. But I swear I
have done nothing for which I might truly fear from a just God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubt melted from Dame Domijaiek&rsquo;s face; she reached out
both hands to take the two of the girl&rsquo;s, saying; &ldquo;My dear, I
could not let you go from here into danger, for that would not
be love. But as for your witchery, we are also told that if one
live in the true world, the outer appearance of evil on all of
us, shall have no force. Each must find his own way to love.
Now you shall tell me the whole story, while I set forth something
to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gave it all fairly, hiding nothing, as they munched
on bread and cheese and pickled onions. When she had finished
on the note of Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s treachery, Dame Domijaiek said;
&ldquo;Ill done, but the poor woman&rsquo;s fault is partly your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard, surprised; &ldquo;How can that be, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes more than one to make a murder. If you had been
wholly ruled by the God of love, the good will you bore her
could not but have been reflected back toward you. Was there
not something, perhaps seeming of slight importance, on which
you felt almost in fury with her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Rodvard flushed (recalling the moment when Mme. Kaja had
burst in to find them on the bed), but Lalette said simply; &ldquo;Yes,
and on a question that most sharply brings angers; to wit, money.
Speaking of which, have you the spadas, Rodvard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. I reached for them where they were on the table
as we went through the window, but they were not there, and I
thought you had taken them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s nostrils moved. &ldquo;A victory for Mme. Kaja. She has
left us penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, an evident result of the fact that you quarrelled
with her on pennies,&rdquo; said Dame Domijaiek.</p>
<p>Rodvard; &ldquo;I will not say I disbelieve you, madame; yet I
cannot see how this is valuable in our present necessity. The
thing&rsquo;s done. Now we have to ask how matters can be bettered,
and how to carry word to my good friend, Dr. Remigorius, so
that we can elude the body of this pursuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow looked at him steadily and though he was new to
this Blue Star, he felt surprise that he could make out nothing
at all behind her eyes, no thought whatever. &ldquo;Ser Bergelin,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;you will one day learn that before you can escape the
world&rsquo;s despairs, you must first escape the world&rsquo;s self. But now
you have been sent to me for help, and helped you shall be.
With what I know of mask-making, I can so alter your appearance
that it will not be hard to pass a relaxed watch. But will
your doctor provide security?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Rodvard, (too quickly, Lalette thought), (and
it was so, for he remembered the moment when he surprised
the doctor&rsquo;s mind, his carelessness of what happened to Lalette.)</p>
<p>Dame Domijaiek gave a trifling sigh. &ldquo;You will be safe here
for the time. But there is a condition to my aid. I believe in a rule
more certain than yours of witchcraft, demoiselle; and will ask
that while you are under my roof, you will banish from your
mind every thought of evil and horror and revenge, even toward
those who have wronged you. It is a protection I ask for me and
my son, though you will not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>By this time it was clear to both Rodvard and Lalette that as
the boy had said, they were certainly in the house of a follower
of the Prophet of Mancherei. Though they did not speak of it,
the thought gave them both an inner qualm, not over being
found there, but at the thought of what might be done to their
inner selves by one of these insidious probers in secret thoughts,
who had so misused their own Prophet. But a mouse cannot
choose the smell of the hole he hides in; they glanced at each
other, and gave the widow their word, as she had asked. The boy
Laduis returned. It was thought better that the pair be somewhat
disguised again, in case of visitors. Lalette kept the Kjermanash
furs; Rodvard at first donned the garb of an executioner,
but the girl not liking him in that, took the gear of a hunter-guide
from the Ragged Mountains instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>It was a morning of nervous attent, through which they heard
feet come and go in the apartment overhead. Between the promise
to the widow and their own feelings, there was hardly anything
that could be said of what they wished to say, so they
spent the time listening to the lad, who told them tales of his
imagined people behind the masks. It would be about the noon-glass
when a man knocked, who said he was the butler of the
Baroness Stampalia to look at a costume; coming so quickly
to the door that Rodvard and Lalette were without time to don
head-masks, and sought refuge in the bedroom. This was as well;
the butler examined attentively everything in the outer room.</p>
<p>Not long later the widow returned, narrowing her eyes over
the tale of the Stampalia butler. &ldquo;She has her own dressmaker.
Could he have been a spy?&rdquo; Then to the couple; &ldquo;You see, you
obeyed my injunction as to thought, and were protected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard would have made a point of this, but Dame Domijaiek
gave him no time, turning to Lalette, with; &ldquo;Touching your
mother, my dear, I think you have not to be troubled. I have
not seen her myself, but the gossip is that Count Cleudi has
most generously sent her a present of money, which is an evidence
of the working of the God of love, though the instrument
may not be what we would desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard, whom this style of discourse filled with a discomfort
he could not readily assay, asked about Remigorius. The
dame had visited his shop; she produced a chit from the doctor
which confirmed all Rodvard&rsquo;s discomforts on the matter of
Lalette, for it commanded him in guarded words to come at once,
and without her. Lalette did not understand when he showed
her the paper, but she said he must clearly go. Dame Domijaiek
added her voice to the same purport, saying that if Rodvard
were needed to go elsewhere, Lalette would be the safer there
for hiding alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>From a cabinet she brought some of the false hair used on
masks and skillfully affixed a fur of it to Rodvard&rsquo;s face, while
Lalette, suddenly gay, changed the dress of his head and added
a ribbon that make him quite a different person. He kissed her
farewell; the widow simpered as though it were she who had
been saluted, and said she would offer an answerable prayer to
the God of love for the success of his going.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">7</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SEDAD VIX: A NEW LIFE</span></h2>
<p>The doorman did not glance from his cachet&mdash;a lazy doorman&mdash;and
the provost on guard at the street entrance was equally indifferent
as Rodvard went past, feeling a trifle unreal after so long
close indoors. Remigorius was compounding a philter with mortar
and pestle; he hailed Rodvard almost boisterously, laughing over
the figure he made in his false facial hair. &ldquo;What! Will you have a
career as a ladies&rsquo; lap-cat, now that you&rsquo;ve turned seducer by profession?
Well, I have summoned you here because things mount to
a crisis. The court&rsquo;s finance is utterly broke, and the High Center
holds that we must move fast, for though there are stirrings in the
west, it seems they move in the direction of Pavinius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard; &ldquo;We are likely to be broke ourselves. Mme.
Kaja&rsquo;s a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pestle stopped in mortar; the doctor&rsquo;s face seemed to narrow
over the midnight thicket of his beard and a soft pink tongue came
out to run a circlet round his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mix that bitch a draft will
burn her guts out. Give me the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard told it all plainly, with the hiding on the rooftop and
the household of the Amorosian woman, over which last Remigorius&rsquo;
eye held some anxiety. &ldquo;The one who came here? You did
not tell her of our fellowship? These people of the Prophet&rsquo;s rule
lie as close together as so many snowflakes, and though they&rsquo;re
as deep against the court as we, I would not trust them. But touching
your affair of the old singer&mdash;&rdquo; he placed one finger to his cheek
and held his eyes averted, so that Rodvard could not see where his
true thought lay &ldquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;re too censorious. I see no real treason
there; she&rsquo;s deep in double intrigues and must keep up an appearance,
beside which, no doubt, there is something of an old woman&rsquo;s
green-sickness for a younger man. It may all have been by order
of the High Center, indeed; you&rsquo;d certainly have been saved yourself
by some tale, for you are now too valuable. Now for our affair;
you are to take the stage at dawning for Sedad Vix, where you are
to be writer for Count Cleudi at the conference of court.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>Rodvard&rsquo;s eyes sprang open wide. &ldquo;The court? Will I not be
known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, nya, you&rsquo;re not involved now in this pursuit of the provosts.
The only one that could establish your communion with the
witch is cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;who would that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pensionnario doorman. An accident happened to him last
night but one; was found in the river this morning, thoroughly
dead and green as a smelt.&rdquo; Remigorius waved a hand goodbye to
Udo the Crab and whipped to his main theme, the conference of
court. Florestan the Chancellor, the army restive for want of pay,
the revenues hypothecated, the question of a great assembly, Cleudi
intriguing, the time come for all terrible measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mathurin can discover all this as clearly as I,&rdquo; said Rodvard
(a little quickfire of suspicion running through him).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better in the open, but we&rsquo;d know the secret purposes, and
whom to trust. Mathurin takes Cleudi to be a spy for the regent
of Tritulacca, despite his ejection from the councils there. Is it
true? You&rsquo;ll find the hiding place of his mind. Then there&rsquo;s Baron
Brunivar, the peoples&rsquo; friend, as they call him. A reputation too
exalted for credit. He&rsquo;s from the West&mdash;is he not by chance in
Prince Pavinius&rsquo; service, seeking to place that worm-bitten saint
on the throne, as prince and Prophet, both together? A thousand
such questions; you&rsquo;ll play in high politics, young man, and earn
yourself a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard (heart beating) said; &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you ask more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(His mind made up with a snap, and as though the words
came from someone else;) &ldquo;Two things. To write a letter to
Demoiselle Asterhax, who will be expecting my return, and to
know how I am to reach Sedad Vix without a spada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remigorius shot him a glance, hit and past (in which there
was annoyance and something like a drop of ink about Lalette).
&ldquo;What, you grasshopper? Always without money. To Sedad Vix
is a spada and two coppers.&rdquo; He drew from his pouch this exact
amount. &ldquo;As for the letter, write. Here&rsquo;s paper, I&rsquo;ll charge myself
with the delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard wrote his letter; discussed through a falling light what
persons might be watched at the villa by the sea, and how to give
the news to Mathurin; dined miserably with the doctor on a stew
that had the sharp taste of meat kept beyond its time, and lay down
exhausted on the floor, with a couple of cushions and his cloak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Sleep withheld its hand; his mind kept running in a circle round
the thought of being a controller of destinies, until he made up a
land of play-show in his head, of being accuser before a court of
the people, with some man who bore a great name as the accused,
and himself making a speech&mdash;&ldquo;But you, your lordship, are a liar
and a traitor. What of your secret adhesion to the Prophet? . . .&rdquo;
The scene he could fix clearly, with the accused&rsquo;s face, and the
members of the court looking grim as the accusation was driven
home, but somehow the people of his drama would not move
around or change expression beyond this one point, and each time
he reached it, the whole thing ended in a white flash, and he
drifted for a while between sleeping and waking, wondering
whether his Blue Star might not be driving him foolish, until the
imagined play began again, without any will of his own. Toward
day, he must have slept a little, for Remigorius was laying a cold
hand on his face, and it was time to look toward the new day
and new life.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>From the city to Sedad Vix by the shore is a fair twelve leagues,
through the most fertile fields in all Dossola, now jumping with new
green, orchards blooming in a row and pale yellow jonquils. Another
time Rodvard had found the trip after they crossed the high bridge
pure pleasure; but now he felt having missed his sleep, and the
travel-mate in the opposite seat was a good-looking pregnant woman,
who said she was going to join her husband, and babbled on
about his position in the royal orchestra till one could not even
doze. The Blue Star said coldly that she was a liar and talking to
hide the true fact, namely that she hated her husband and pregnancy
and the love of any man, and as soon as she was free of her
condition, hoped to catch the eye of some wealthy lady and to be
maintained for pleasures impermissible&mdash;so vile a thought that Rodvard
closed his eyes. The man next to him was a merchant of some
kind by the badge in his cap; he kept addressing heavy-handed
compliments to the dame, saying that he would dance with her at
the spring festival and the like. Rodvard, turning, could see he
thought her licentious, and was determined to profit by it at some
future time. At Masjon, where they stopped for lunch, the merchant-man
bought a whole roasted chicken and a bottle of that fine white
Tritulaccan wine which is called The Honey of the Hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Rodvard himself was a little faint from lack of food when he
reached the royal villa after a solid half-league of trudging beyond
the stage-post, nor did the under-butler who received him offer food,
but took him at once to a cabinet looking out over a terraced flower-garden,
at the back of the rambling building. This guide said to
wait for the arrival of Ser Tuol&eacute;n, the butler-in-chief. The name
had a Kjermanash sound; and sure enough, the tall man who came
after perhaps half an hour&rsquo;s retard, had the high-bridged nose and
curling hair of that northern land. Rodvard stood to greet him with
extended hand, and as he looked into the eyes, received a shock
that ran through him like poison-fire, with its indubitable message
that he was facing another wearer of the Blue Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Ser Bergelin?&rdquo; The eyes looked at him fixedly though
the lips did not cease smiling. &ldquo;What is your function to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writer to the Count Cleudi for the conference,&rdquo; Rodvard managed
to say. (One almost seemed to drown in those eyes, liquid and
northern blue, but he could not read a single thought behind them.)</p>
<p>The smile expanded. &ldquo;You will find it easier to meet others who
<i>know</i> when you have borne that stone for a time. I perceive it is a
novelty to you. There are not many of us. Hmmm&mdash;I suppose it is
little use asking you why Count Cleudi wishes a Blue Star with him.
No matter; I have watched him before, and it is no secret that he
wishes to be Chancellor; even Lord Florestan knows that. I trust
you are not an Amorosian or one of that band of assassins who
call themselves Sons of the New Day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rodvard (and thought with the back of his mind
that this was why all plans to deal directly with the court had
broken, and others of the brotherhood been laid in the toils of the
provosts, this Star-bearer here.) With the front of his thought he
concentrated on looking at the detail in the painting of a milkmaid
just beyond Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>The butler-in-chief turned. &ldquo;It is by Raubasco. He was not satisfied
with the highlights in the middle distance, as I discovered by
a means you will understand, so it was easy to persuade the painting
away from him. Do you intend to bring your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rodvard, (thinking quickly on Lalette and as quickly
away).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is something wrong with the personal relation. Perhaps
it is just as well if you do not; Her Majesty is not prudish,
but she does not approve of witches at the court. Your room will
be at the depth of the west wing, beyond the hall of conference. I
will have one of the under-butlers show you.&rdquo; He stood up, then
paused with one hand holding the bell-rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;One last word. A Bearer finds himself in a strange position here
without his witch. I suppose your wife has given you the usual warning
about infidelity, but you are clearly new to the jewel and
young, and there are not a few ladies who might make the loss
seem worth the gain&mdash;since you can read their desires. In particular
I warn you to stand clear of the Countess Aiella of Arjen, in whom
I have noted something of the kind. She is involved with the Duke
of Aggermans, a man who&rsquo;ll protect his own dangerously. . . .
Drop in tomorrow night after Cleudi releases you; it will be a
pleasure to compare things seen with another Bearer. I have not
met one for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the room was a tray of food on the table, ample and well
selected, with a bottle of wine; three or four books also, but they
were all gesling-romances, and of a kind Rodvard found it difficult
to bear even when well written, as these hardly were. He
glanced at each in turn, then tossed them aside, and was only
rescued from boredom by Mathurin&rsquo;s coming, who pressed his
hands, and said he would come the next evening again, but for the
now, he must hurry.</p>
<p>Rodvard replied that the high butler Tuol&eacute;n was the bearer of
a Star, and Mathurin must either avoid his eye or keep his own
thought on innocuous subjects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his witch? Wait, no, that explains much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see,&rdquo; said Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, fool, the hold the court party has. No sooner a man turns
up that&rsquo;s in opposition than your Tuol&eacute;n knows his most secret
purpose, and I do not doubt that his wife witches the man. This
is something for the High Center of the New Day.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>A pretty maid brought him breakfast in bed. She gave him a
cheerful morning greeting but embarrassed him by hoping in her
thought that he would not make love to her. Her mind held some
memory of how the last man in this room had done so, but she
shied from the thought of the outcome so much that instead of
decently avoiding her look Rodvard was tempted to pry deeper,
but there was hardly time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>She said it would be near to noon when Count Cleudi rose and
that his apartment was in one of the pavilions set among tree and
shrub and garden, west from the main villa. Rodvard dressed and
went to stroll in that direction through curved avenues among intricate
beds of spring flowers&mdash;tulip and narcissus, with pink azaleas
just in the bud beside them and magnolia showing its heavy white
wax. The pathways had been laid out so that each sweep brought
somewhere into view through trees the pale blue bay, with the white
houses of Sedad Vix climbing the slope beyond, their walls touched
to gold by genial sunshine; bright yellow birds were singing overhead,
or busily gathering morsels for their nests. Rodvard felt his
heart expanding with a joyous certainty that all would yet be well,
though in the same tick demanding of himself how men who dwelt
in such surroundings could be given to evil and oppression. Ah, if
all people could only walk in gardens daily! A question in philosophy
to put to the doctor&mdash;but before he could frame it into words,
a turn of the path brought him past a tall clump of rhododendrons
to the front of a red-doored pavilion, where a gardener was letting
into the ground plants of blooming hyacinth.</p>
<p>The air was rich with their fragrance. &ldquo;Good morning to you,&rdquo;
said Rodvard cheerfully, for joy of the world.</p>
<p>The man looked up with lips that turned down at the corners.
&ldquo;If you say it is a good morning, I suppose it must be one for
you,&rdquo; he said, and turned back to his trowel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I would call it the best of mornings. Does not the fine
air of it please you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s amiss? Have you troubles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has not?&rdquo; The gardener slapped his trowel against the
ground beside his latest plant. &ldquo;Look at these flowers, now. Just
smell that white one there, it&rsquo;s more fragrant than the blue. Aren&rsquo;t
they beautiful things? Brought here at expense, and in this soil, see
how black it is, they would grow more perfect than ever, year by
year. But here&rsquo;s the end of them; as soon as the blossoms fade ever
so little, poor things, they must be dug up and thrown away, because
she&mdash;&rdquo; he swung his head and rolled an eye in the direction
of the red-doored pavilion &ldquo;&mdash;can&rsquo;t bear to have any but blooming
flowers at her door and will want new lilies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Rodvard, lowering his tone for fear that
voices will sometimes carry through wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Countess Aiella. Her affair, you will be saying, whether
flowers die or live; she has all that income from the Arjen estates,
and doesn&rsquo;t have to provide for her brothers, who married those
two heiresses up in Bregatz, but a man could still weep for the
waste of the flowers. Ser, give a thought to it, how in the world
we never have enough of beauty and those who destroy any part
of it take something from all other people. Is it not true, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused on his knees and looked up at Rodvard (who was
growing interested indeed, but now felt the coldness of the Blue
Star telling him that this earthy philosopher was not thinking
of beauty at all, but only reciting a lesson and wondering whether
his pretty speech might not draw him a gift from this poetical-looking
young man.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have no money to give
away,&rdquo; and turned to go, but he had not travelled a dozen paces
when he met one who must be the Countess Aiella herself by the
little double coronet in her drag-edge hat. Rodvard doffed to the
coronet, noting in the fleeting second of his bow the passionate,
bewildering beauty of the face surrounded by curves of light-brown
hair.</p>
<p>She stopped. &ldquo;Put it on,&rdquo; she said, and he looked up at her. The
cloak did not conceal the fact that she was still dressed for evening;
a leg showed through the slit in her dress. &ldquo;I have not seen
you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your grace. I only arrived last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your badge says you are a clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a writer to the Count Cleudi for this conference.&rdquo; (He
dared to look into the eyes a finger-joint length below his own;
behind them there was boredom with a faint flicker of interest in
himself and the thought of having spent a bad night; a weary
thought.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count Cleudi, oh. You might be him in disguise.&rdquo; She laughed
a laugh that trilled up the scale, slipped past him with a motion
as lithe as a gazelle&rsquo;s and up the path into the red-doored pavilion.
Rodvard looked after her until he heard the gardener cackle, then,
a little angry with himself, stamped on round the turn of the path,
trying to recover the glory of the morning. Some of it came back,
but not enough to prevent him thinking more on the comparison
between this countess and Lalette than the difference between this
day and any other day; and so he reached Cleudi&rsquo;s door, with its
device of a fishing bird carved into the wood.</p>
<p>Mathurin greeted him properly in words to show he and Rodvard
barely had met each other. The pavilion was all on one floor,
the Count in a room at the side, with a man doing his hair while
he sipped hot spiced wine, from which a delicious odor floated.
Rodvard had heard of, but never seen this famous exile and intriguer;
he looked into a narrow face with a broad brow above a
sharp nose and lips that spoke of self-indulgence. Mathurin pronounced
the name of the new writer; a pair of dark eyes looked at
Rodvard broodingly (the thought behind them wondering what
his weakness was and how he would cheat). Said Cleudi:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not ask your earlier employment, since it is of no moment
if you are faithful and intelligent. I cannot bear stupidity. Can you
read Tritulaccan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will gain nothing by attempting to flatter me with the
form of address. On the side table are pens and papers, also a
horoscope which has been cast in Tritulaccan and a poem in your
own musical language. Make fair copies of both in Dossolan. Have
you breakfasted?&rdquo; (His accent had the slight overemphasis on S
which no Tritulaccan ever loses.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symbols on the astrological chart were new to Rodvard; he
had to copy each by sheer drawing and then translate the terms as
best he might. The poem was a sonnet in praise of a brown-haired
lady; its meter limped at two points. Rodvard managed to correct
one of them by a transposition of words and presently laid both
papers before Cleudi, who knit his brows over them for a moment
and smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very daring writer to improve on what I have set
down, but it is well done. Mathurin, give him a scuderius. Well
then, you are to wait on me in the conference at nine glasses of
the afternoon. Everything I say is to be set down, and also the remarks
of the Chancellor Florestan, but most especially those of the
Baron Brunivar, for these may be of future use. Of the others, whatever
you yourself, consider worth while. You are dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin saw him to the door. &ldquo;The scuderius?&rdquo; asked Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goes into the treasury of our Center,&rdquo; said the servitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no money, no money at all,&rdquo; protested Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish, you do not need it here. Would you starve our high purpose
to feed your personal pleasure in little things? I will come
to your room tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">8</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HIGH POLITIC</span></h2>
<p>Although the day was bright outside, little light could seep
through the leaded panes and what little light there was had been
cut off by heavily looped curtains. There were candles down the
long table and in brackets on the walls. In the marble fireplace at
the high end of the room a small flame smouldered under the stone
cupids; before it three men were standing, with goes of brandy in
their hands. Baron Brunivar was recognizable by his description&mdash;tall,
with a mane of white hair and a firm-set mouth that made one
think of the word &ldquo;nobility&rdquo; without reference to civil condition.
He was talking with a short, round man who looked as jolly as he
could possibly be and a dark, grave-faced lord who held a kitten
in his arm till the little thing struggled to be set down, whereupon
it played round his feet, catching for the shoe-laces. In spite of his
solemnity, this would be Florestan, the Laughing Chancellor; he
was known to favor cats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>In a moment he looked around and signed to Tuol&eacute;n the head
butler, who rapped a little silver bell on the table. All the men
from various corners of the room gathered. Three of them were
episcopals in their violet robes with flowers of office. Florestan
quietly waited till all were at rest, his visage in calm lines (but
Rodvard could see just enough of his eyes to catch an intimation
that this might be a grim business). He tapped the bell once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords, if you were ignorant of this convocation&rsquo;s purpose,
you had not been summoned; therefore, let us leave all preliminaries
and turn straight to the matter of Her Majesty&rsquo;s finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pause. The apple-faced man said; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to say of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is a very dangerous thing to have the court in poverty
when we are threatened with this question of the succession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faces along the table watched him attentively, all set in
varying degrees of stubbornness, and as the kitten scratched at the
leg of his chair, he reached down to pet it. &ldquo;My lords, this has now
grown so grave that we can dissolve our troubles only by measures
never taken before; all the old means eaten up. Yet we still want
money to pay Her Majesty&rsquo;s army, which is not only a disgraceful
thing but also a perilous. Those who should protect us may become
our persecutors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little round man&rsquo;s smile was jolly as before, his voice not;
&ldquo;Your Grace, a bug close to the eye may look as big as a lion. Is
there proof of true disaffection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man with silver-streaked hair and the breast-star of a general
on his silk nodded gloomily. &ldquo;I bear such proof. This brawl among
the Red Archers of Veierelden has been given a light appearance;
but my men have looked into it, and it runs deeper than you think.
Namely, they were shouting for the restoration of Pavinius to the
succession. We hanged one of his emissaries, a Mayern man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah,&rdquo; said the round man. &ldquo;Since he was exiled every ruction
has been a shout for his return. They do not mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dossola will never bear a king who is himself the leader of a
sect opposed to true religion,&rdquo; observed one of the episcopals. &ldquo;Even
his one-time followers of the Amorosian faith have rejected him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Florestan held up his hand. &ldquo;My lords, you wander. I summoned
you here on this matter of finance to say that it is within
the powers granted to me as minister by the Queen&rsquo;s Majesty to
establish by decree the new form of tax-payment proposed by our
good friend, the Count Cleudi. Yet as some of you have been good
enough to let me know this plan will never succeed, I now ask
what other you propose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a plan to steal from the nobles of the land, and it will
surely not be borne,&rdquo; said a long-faced man with great force.</p>
<p>Said one of the episcopals; &ldquo;The estates of the Church must of
course be exempt from this plan; for it would be an affront to the
most high God to make his spiritual ministers into tax-gatherers
for the lesser, or civil estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chancellor Florestan threw back his head with a burst of laughter
so heartily sustained that it was not hard to see how he had
won his calling-name. &ldquo;The same spiritual ministers,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;have little trouble with their consciences when it is a question of
collecting taxes to their own benefit. No, I do not contemplate that
the lords episcopal shall be exempt, however ill that sits, and I tell
you plainly that I will enforce this plan with every strength there
is. Come, my lords, you waste my time, which belongs to the
Queen; and so dissipate her resources. I ask again; who has a
sharper scheme than Cleudi&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they burst in on him with a flood of words like so many
dogs barking, which he hardly seemed to hear as he leaned down
to pet the kitten. Rodvard, watching the calm indifferent face,
could not catch a clear vision of the eyes in the candlelight and
flow of movement. He saw Tuol&eacute;n advance to pick up one of the
glasses, with his eyes fixed on the horsefaced lord who had been
so vehement (and it came to him that Florestan must know there
was another Blue Star in the room, and be concealing his thought
from reading). The Chancellor reached over to tap his bell once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hear the Baron Brunivar,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The lord he mentioned turned a stately head, (but though he
was squarely in face, Rodvard could only make out a thought
troubled and urgent; nothing definite.) &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;when I first learned of this plan, I thought it was put forward
merely to provoke a better. Now I see that it is not, and though I
have no plan for raising more money, only for spending less, I ask
you to think what will happen if you persist in it. More taxes cannot
be borne by the commonalty; they&rsquo;ll rise, and you&rsquo;ll have
Prince Pavinius over the border with a Mayern army at his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Laughing Chancellor turned his head and said to his own
writer at the side table; &ldquo;Be it noted that Baron Brunivar spoke of
treason and wars in the west, where his seignory lies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>White eyebrows flashed up and down over Brunivar&rsquo;s orbits.
&ldquo;You shall not make me a traitor so, Your Grace. I have stood in
the battlefield against this Pavinius when he was Prophet of Mancherei,
with all Tritulacca to aid him; and there were some who
fled.&rdquo; He looked along the table. &ldquo;It is not exterior war I fear, but
Dossolans at each others&rsquo; throats, and an unpaid army against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florestan&rsquo;s voice tolled; &ldquo;Write it down that the Baron Brunivar
doubts the army&rsquo;s loyalty to Her Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brunivar&rsquo;s face became a grimace, but he plunged on. &ldquo;Let me
beg Your Grace: could not enough be saved on the household
budget for the spring festival to keep the army happy for long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it down that the Baron Brunivar declares Her Majesty
to be extravagant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say no more. You have my completest word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Cleudi lightly; &ldquo;I thank you, my lord Brunivar, for having
shown that no plan but mine will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brunivar&rsquo;s mouth flew open and shut again. Said one of the
episcopals; &ldquo;Let us think if there be not another plan. I have heard
that in some of the estates of Kjermanash, when extraordinary
measures are needed, they have a tax on flour which is levied at
the mill; most collectible, since no one can avoid it if he wishes to
eat bread. Could not a similar be laid here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florestan&rsquo;s lips twitched. Brunivar struck the table. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d
done, but this outdoes all. My lord, in the west it is exactly that
our people have not coppers enough both to buy bread and pay
their present taxes that has roused our troubles. Will you starve
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fat man said; &ldquo;Yet the present revenues are not
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general murmur. Brunivar stood up in his place at the table.
&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am forced to this issue. The burden lies not
on the court alone, but on all of you. The popular can pay no more;
whatever comes, must come from our estates. It has been so since
the Tritulaccan war and the loss of the Mancherei revenues that
kept us all in luxury. We in the western seignories have made some
sacrifice toward the happiness of our people, out of free will and
the love of humankind. We have been without the troubles that
vex such seignories as yours, Your Grace of Aggermans&mdash;&rdquo; he
looked at the round man &ldquo;&mdash;and without witchings. And this, I
think, is because we show some love for those we rule.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Cleudi lifted his hand for speech and the Chancellor signed to
him. He said; &ldquo;I speak here under permission, being a foreigner,
and not familiar with these new religions that have vexed and
divided the ancient realm of Dossola and its former dominion overseas.
I would ask whether the Baron Brunivar&rsquo;s talk of love for
humankind places him more definitely with the Amorosians who
follow the first doctrine of the Prince-Prophet, or with those who
now accept his word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head bent to set down these words, Rodvard did not catch a
glimpse of Brunivar&rsquo;s face at this accusation, but he heard the
quick gasp of breath that was covered by Florestan&rsquo;s laughter.
The Chancellor said; &ldquo;My lords, and fellow-scoundrels of Baron
Brunivar&rsquo;s accusation, I think this most happily clears the air. You
see where the true resistance to Count Cleudi&rsquo;s plan for taxes lies,
and on what ground. Will you make yourselves one with that purpose,
which is clearly nothing but the establishment over us of
Pavinius and his form of witchcraft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes swept the table, and the noble lords and episcopals
stirred in their seats, but nobody said a word. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll add more.
You are jealous of your privilege, my lords, as to this new plan,
and fear the government will be the only gainer. By no means; it
is only a device of finance which will in the end work favorably
for all. You are charged with the taxes due from your seignories,
yes. But when this happens there is created a class of financial
paper which, having value, can be bought and sold; I mean the
warrants drawn by the court on you for the tax-monies. Good;
Her Majesty&rsquo;s government will sell these warrants at discount to
Zigraners and others who love to speculate. There&rsquo;s a fine speculation;
for instance, will the tax on the province of Aggermans yield
twice what it did last year&mdash;or the half? Thus the paper will change
hands; but at every change of ownership in the paper, the government
takes a small tax on the transaction, small enough not to
discourage the purchase and sale. Thus we are provided instantly
with the full treasury we must have, obtaining it from the sale of
the warrants; and at the same time we have a steady source of income,
while you, my lords, lose nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small fat man who had identified himself as the Duke of
Aggermans spoke up; &ldquo;It all sounds very well, but why must the
nobles of the realm be converted into money-grubbing tax-gatherers
as though we had Zigraner blood? What! Can you not cheat the
speculators as well by selling them paper on taxes collected direct,
in the name of the Queen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>The Laughing Chancellor flung out a hand. &ldquo;Why, touching
your first question, my lord, you&rsquo;ll be no more a tax-gatherer than
you are today; only the agents who now speak in Her Majesty&rsquo;s
name will be by degrees transferred to your service. From this you&rsquo;ll
benefit; for some of these taxes will be paid in early and you will
have the handling of the monies until the government&rsquo;s paper
against you falls due. As to the second, why if we are to enlist
the speculators to our work, it must surely be through having
papers of different values, which go up and down from one seignory
to another, instead of all being equal, as the government&rsquo;s own
obligation is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general said; &ldquo;The monies must come soon, if we&rsquo;re to have
peace with the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florestan stood. &ldquo;The session may be considered closed.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Outside the hall it was a shock to come into bright flowers and
green. The sun was just plunging down behind the low green hills
westward, the birds singing sleep-songs and everything in perfect
peace, not a leaf in movement. Tuol&eacute;n the butler tapped Rodvard
on the shoulder and when they were together in his cabinet,
brought forth a bottle of Kjermanash ceriso, held it up to contemplate
the ruby glow against the falling light and poured into
goblets of crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found it diverting, Ser Bergelin? His Grace is very astute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard, sipping, perceived that a reply was asked. &ldquo;Did he
convince them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were your eyes? Ah, over your papers. But surely you
saw enough to know that conviction was beyond His Grace&rsquo;s purpose?
The lords episcopal will never be convinced; the lords militant
are convinced already. Did you watch Brunivar when Cleudi
accused him of being a follower of Pavinius, whether as Prince or
Prophet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been worth your trouble. There was that something
like a golden flash which always comes when a man discovers
that what he has said in innocency may be taken as the product
of a guilty mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty?&rdquo; Rodvard&rsquo;s surprise broke through the guard he had
set on his thought. &ldquo;I am new to this Blue Star, but saw no guilt,
only an honest man who would help others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler&rsquo;s permanent smile came up out of his crystal. &ldquo;Honest?
Honest? I imagine Brunivar may answer to that. A tradesman&rsquo;s
quality at best; I look for it in dealers who furnish the court with
pork. But in high policy, that type will hardly gain one more than
a length of cold ground&mdash;which it will now do for Brunivar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Rodvard looked down. &ldquo;Then&mdash;then His Grace was playing a
game with Brunivar, to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make this public confession that he is either an Amorosian
or a follower of the Prince. As you clearly discovered. The episcopals
can never let that fall. They can no more have a man of such
opinions as regent-apparent than they could have Pavinius for king.
So now there will be an accusation and a trial and Brunivar walking
the walk to meet the throat-cutter on the scaffold, for I doubt they
can afford banishment. Not while Her Majesty insists on carrying
through the old King&rsquo;s will that makes Brunivar regent-apparent
for his honesty if the throne falls vacant. But mark the astuteness
of His Grace, who at the same time destroys the popular party by
taking off its best leader. But I do not think more will be until after
the spring festival, since to condemn Brunivar now would give him
the cancellation of punishments which the festival entails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a grunting laugh, drained his ceriso, refilled his own
goblet and brought Rodvard&rsquo;s up to the brim, while the latter&rsquo;s
thoughts whirled wildly, to cover which he asked; &ldquo;The short man,
always smiling, though he spoke so sourly, was the Duke of Aggermans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. One to watch. I have caught him thinking of schemes by
which he may one day reach the Chancellor&rsquo;s seat. That is why he
opposes Cleudi. . . . Ser, why are you so deep in turmoil of mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose it must have something to do with Baron Brunivar,&rdquo;
said Rodvard (not daring to try to conceal). &ldquo;I have always
heard him well spoke of as a man who thinks of the benefit of
others than himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steady smile became a chuckle. &ldquo;So he does. These are the
most dangerous kind in politic. The next step beyond thinking on
the good of others is deciding what that good will be. A privilege
reserved to God. But is not His Grace astute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it seems to me shocking that a man who has done no
wrong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see where you lead. Ser Bergelin, wrong is not in acts
alone, or else every soldier would be a criminal, but in the thoughts
with which they are done.&rdquo; He tapped the jacket just over his
heart, where the Blue Star would hang, and for the first time the
smile left his face. &ldquo;When you have borne one of these baubles as
long as I, you will learn something&mdash;namely, that few of us are
different from the rest. I saw a man in a dungeon once, a murderer,
whose thoughts were better than those of the deacon who gave him
consolation. To my mind, that is. You or another might take those
same thoughts for hideous. Take now your Baron Brunivar, who
seems so lofty to you because on one range of topic his desires
chime with your own. Yet you are not his identical; watch him, I
say, and you will find his gold more than half brass in another
light. Wrong? Right? I do not know what value they have to one
who wears the Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Let conscience die. The hours wheeled timeless past as they so
often do when there is a change in outer circumstance so sharp
that landmarks vanish. Let conscience die; was it true? Rodvard
thought of the high ideals of service with which he had joined the
Sons of the New Day&mdash;was any purpose as good as another? Lalette;
his mind shot off on a sudden tangent of tenderness toward her,
who fairly desired to be a good partner, it might be for her own
interest, but still making two instead of one against a world; and
Mathurin came in.</p>
<p>When he was told that Baron Brunivar was likely to be condemned
only for being the best man in the state and its appointed
future regent, his eyes burned like coal-fires; he said; &ldquo;It is the
thing we need; the people will not bear to hear it; they will rise.
First gain for your Blue Star, friend.&rdquo; He ran out with his nose
sharpened by excitement, his eyes glowing like those of a rat.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">9</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SPRING FESTIVAL: INTRIGUE OF COUNT CLEUDI</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now the mask, Mathurin,&rdquo; said Count Cleudi. One corner of his
lip twitched (the black eyes glinting with malice). He seemed as
light and strong as one of those bronze statues of the winged man,
knuckles resting on the table. His own costume was a rich purple,
as he glanced from the mirror to Rodvard&rsquo;s face, masked down to
the lower cheeks, but with the lips bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chin is much alike. Turn around, Bergelin, slowly, pivoting
on the ball of the right foot. So.&rdquo; He lifted his own right arm,
slightly bent, dropped his left hand to dagger-hilt, and illustrated.
Rodvard tried to follow him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite right with the dagger; you are jerky. But you will
hardly be dancing a corabando. Have the goodness to walk across
the room. Stand. Mathurin, where does he lack the resemblance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant&rsquo;s fingers came up to his lip. &ldquo;The voice is almost
perfect, my lord, but there is something in the movement of the
hands not quite . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only birth that does it,&rdquo; said Cleudi. &ldquo;The wrist laces; he
is not very used to handling them. But for the rest, Bergelin, you
were born a most accomplished mimic and swindler. Remind me
to dismiss you before your natural talent is turned in my direction.
Now the instruction; repeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to be at the ball when the opera is over, at least a glass
before midnight. The fourth box on the left-hand side is yours. I
am to look at the doorbase of the second box, where a handkerchief
will be caught. If it is white, edged with lace, perfumed with
honeymusk, I am to go below and make myself seen at the gaming
tables. But if the handkerchief is blue and rose-perfumed, I am to
take it away and leave in its place another; then without being seen
on the dancing floor or at the games, go at once to my lord&rsquo;s box,
but leave the panels up and the curtains closed. Someone will
presently tap twice, a lady. I am to greet her with my lord&rsquo;s sonnet,
eat with her; declare my passion for her . . . My lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if&mdash;that is&mdash;I would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleudi shot him a gleam (containing amusement mingled with
a little dark shade of cruelty and the thought of shaming him with
the full statement of his quaver). &ldquo;You want money, apprentice
swindler? You should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord, it is not that, but&mdash;.&rdquo; The Count&rsquo;s toe tapped, his
expression became a rictus, and Rodvard rushed on with heat at
the back of his neck. &ldquo;What if the intrigue does not succeed, that is
if you do not appear in time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rictus became a bark. &ldquo;Ha&mdash;why, then you must suffer the
horrid fate of being alone in a secluded apartment with the shapeliest
and most willing woman in Dossola. Are you impotent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard half opened his mouth to protest in stumbling words
that he was a promised man, who thought it less than honest to
violate his given word, but Mathurin tittered and (the stream of
hate and fury that flowed from those black eyes!) he only made a
small sound. Cleudi barked again:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Will you be a theologian, then? It is she who should make
confession, not you&mdash;by the wise decision of the Church, as I was
discussing but lately with the Episcopal of Zenss. The minor priests
will say otherwise; but it is a reflection from the old days, before
the present congress of episcopals. Listen, peasant; is it not manifestly
to the glory of God that men should seek women for their
first and highest pleasure, as it is that daughters should have all
monetary inheritance? Is it not also manifest that all would be
under the rule of women, who have the Art as well as their arts,
unless some disability lay upon them. . . . Ah, chutte! Why do I
talk like a deacon to a be-damned clerk? Enough that I have given
you an order. Greater things than you think hang on this intrigue,
and you&rsquo;ll execute it well, or by the Service, I&rsquo;ll reduce you to a
state where no woman will tempt you again. Now take off that
finery; be prompt here at two glasses before midnight for Mathurin
to dress you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;But where does this intrigue lead?&rdquo; asked Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not your Blue Star give you a clue?&rdquo; said Mathurin.
They sat on a green bank behind the hall of conference, many-colored
tulips waving in the light breeze about them, and Rodvard
carefully tore one of the long leaves to ribbons as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. There may have been something about Aggermans in it,
but he was not thinking of his central purpose at all, only about
how it would be a nasty joke and a revenge. What&mdash;&rdquo; (it was behind
his lips to ask what he should do lest he lose the power of
the Blue Star, but in midflight he changed) &ldquo;&mdash;what have you done
toward saving Baron Brunivar? Will there be a rising?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(There was a quick note of suspicion and surprise in the eyes
that lifted to meet his.) &ldquo;Nothing for now, but to let Remigorius,
and through him the High Center, know what&rsquo;s in prospect. There&rsquo;s
no accusation as matters stand; it will gain us nothing merely to
put out the story that the court plots against him. . . . Yet I do not
understand why he has failed to fly when it&rsquo;s as clear as summer
light that Florestan means the worse toward him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I do not understand,&rdquo; said Rodvard, &ldquo;is why the High
Center has failed to make more preparation. It will be too late
when Brunivar&rsquo;s been placed in a dungeon, under guard and accusation
with a shar of soldiers around him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would never pass . . .&rdquo; Mathurin&rsquo;s voice trailed off; he contemplated
the lawns, brow deep, and Rodvard could not see his
thought. &ldquo;I can understand the High Center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would never pass? You are more mysterious than the
Count, friend Mathurin, with your hints here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>The servitor turned on him eyes of angry candor. &ldquo;Rodvard
Yes-and-No, my friend, Cleudi is right in calling you more of a
moralist than a churchman is. By what right do you question me
so? Do you think I am of the High Center? Yet I will show you
some of the considerations. It will never pass that the Chancellor
should execute Brunivar and then have it proved that this fate came
on him for some private reason. And now that you whip me to it,
I will say as well that it will never pass that Brunivar should not
be executed while we cry shame. We need a general rising, not a
rescue that will drive many of us abroad. People will not leave
their lives to fight until there is something in those lives that may
not be sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Conscience again.) Rodvard set his mouth. &ldquo;If you wish the
reign of justice for others, it seems to me that you must give it
yourself, Mathurin, and I see no justice in watching a good man
condemned to death when he might be saved. I heard the Baron
speak out in conference, and he may yet win something there. But
even fled to Tritulacca, or to Mayern and Prince Pavinius, he would
still be worth more than with his throat cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serving man stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not chop logic against you; only
say, beware. For you are a member under orders; your own will or
moral has nothing to do with the acts of the High Center. Brunivar
is nothing to us; down with him, he is a part of the dead past which
is all rotten at the heart, and of which we must rid ourselves for
the living future. I will see you later, friend Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>A tray had been left in his room as usual, but Rodvard hardly
ate from it before flinging himself down to lie supine, watching
the pattern of light through the shutters as it slowly ticked across
the wall, trying to resolve the problem that beset him. Brunivar
with his noble aspect and surely, his noble mind. &ldquo;Free will and
the love of humankind,&rdquo; the Baron had said, and they called it the
doctrine of the apostate Prophet. Yet for what else had he himself
joined the Sons of the New Day? What else had the Baron put into
practice out there in his province of the west?</p>
<p>Yet here is Mathurin saying that no happiness could be bought
by love of humankind, since certainly no love of humankind would
let a high man go to shameful death when it might be prevented.
No, perhaps that was not true, either; even barbarians had sacrifices
by which one gave his life that many might live, though their
method in this was all superstition and clearly wrong. . . . But
only by the consent of the one, Rodvard answered himself; only
when there was no way but sacrifice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>Brunivar had made no consent; was being pushed to a sacrifice
by malignance on one side, with the other accepting the unwilling
gift he gave. Yet in that acceptance was there not something base
and selfish? He remembered the curious unformed thought of
treachery he had surprised in Remigorius&rsquo; mind, Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s active
betrayal, Mathurin&rsquo;s violence, and was glad they were joined with
him, in one of the minor Centers of the Sons of the New Day. When
that Day rose&mdash;but then, too late for Brunivar. Ah, if there were
some deliverance, some warning one could give that would be
heeded.</p>
<p>A clock somewhere boomed four times. Rodvard twisted on the
bed, thinking bitterly how little he could do even to save himself,
willing in that moment to be the sacrificed one. With witchery
one might&mdash;Lalette . . . Little cold drops of perspiration gathered
down his front from neck to navel at the perilousness of the intrigue
in which he was now embarked for the night, perilous and
yet sweet, delight and danger, so that with half his mind he
wished to rise and run from this accursed place, come what might.
With the other half it was to stay and hope that Cleudi would not
interrupt the rendezvous in the box, as he had said, so that the
heart-striking loveliness he had now and again seen from far in the
last seven days (for he did not doubt that the mask to meet him in
the box would cover the Countess Aiella) might lie in his arms,
come what might to the felon of Lalette&rsquo;s witcheries. Was he himself
one of those whose purposes were hideous, as Tuol&eacute;n the butler
had put it, with an inner desire toward treachery toward her who
had received his word of love? Wait&mdash;the word had been wrung
from him, given under a compulsion, was the product of a deed
done under another compulsion. This, too. Before a high court I
will plead (thought Rodvard) that I myself, the inner me who
cherishes ideals still, in spite of Mathurin or Tuol&eacute;n, had no part
in betrayals . . . and recognized as he thought thus, that the union
in the place of masks was of that very inner me, given forever . . .
or forever minus a day.</p>
<p>Flee, then. Where? A marked man and a penniless, trying to escape
across the seignories, with only a clerk&rsquo;s skill, which demands
fixities, to gain bread. Brunivar might perhaps be held from flying
to safety by compulsions as tight as these&mdash;at which the wheel of
thought had turned full circle; and the realization of this shattering
the continuance of the motion, Rodvard drifted off into an uneasy
doze, twitching in his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>He came fully awake with a final jerk, swinging feet to the
floor in the twilight; stood up, made a light, and not daring to go
on with his self-questionings, pecked a little at the gelid remains of
his noon viands, while speculating on Cleudi&rsquo;s intrigue. But the
Count had so buried the line of his plan that nothing could be
made of this, either; Rodvard went to seek Tuol&eacute;n, in the hope that
he might have some light. Vain hope; the butler&rsquo;s cabinet was dark
and everyone else encountered in the corridors was hurrying, hurrying,
with burdens here and there, in preparation for the grand
ball. There was an atmosphere of anticipatory excitement that built
up along Rodvard&rsquo;s nerve-chains until he stepped forth into the
spring eve to escape it.</p>
<p>Out there, the evening had turned chill, with a damp breeze off
the Eastern Sea that spoke of rain before sun. All the flowers
seemed to have folded their wings around themselves to meet it,
and Rodvard felt as though nature had turned her back. He longed
for a voice, and as a girl&rsquo;s form came shadowy around a turn of the
path, he gave her good-evening and asked if he might bear her
burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, it is not needed,&rdquo; said she, drawing back; but a shaft of
light from a window caught them both and there was mutual recognition,
she being the breakfast chambermaid, whose name was
Damaris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your pardon, Ser,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is most good of you,&rdquo; and
let him take her package, which was, in truth, heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this must be gold or lead or beef, not flowers as it should
be on festival eve,&rdquo; he said, and she trilled a small laugh before
answering that festival it might be for those badged with coronets
or quills, but for her class it was a night of labor&mdash;&ldquo;and it is not
gold, or I would run away with it, but one of those double bottles
of Arjen fired-wine for the box of the Count Cleudi, whom you
serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her head, and in the light which threw across the
path from another window, he caught a glint of her eyes. (She was
very friendly after a week of bringing him breakfasts, in which he
had treated her as courteously as though she were high born.) &ldquo;Will
you have no festival at all, then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, tomorrow afternoon, when all the court&rsquo;s asleep. In the
evening when they wake, it will be duty again.&rdquo; They had reached
the door of the great hall; within workmen were attaching flowers
to the bowered dais where the musicians would play, there was a
sound of hammering from somewhere along the balcony behind
the boxes, and Tuol&eacute;n the high butler was revolving in the midst
of the dancing floor, pointing where a flower-chain should be draped
or a chair placed. His movement was that almost-prance which
Cleudi had demonstrated. The girl&rsquo;s face turned toward Rodvard
(her eyes suddenly said she wished him to ask her something, he
could not quite make out what, they were so quickly withdrawn,
but it was connected with the festival).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no festival myself unless someone takes pity on me,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>(That was it.) &ldquo;Would you&mdash;come and dance with me? It is only
a servants&rsquo; ball . . .&rdquo; (She was a little frightened at her own boldness
in asking someone so far above her in station, yet trembling-hopeful
he would accept.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;have you no partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend has been called away to serve in the army. I have
my ticket already and it will only be three spadas for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Somehow he would get them; it would be an afternoon of real
relaxation from complexities.) &ldquo;You honor me, Demoiselle Damaris.
Where shall I meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will wake you with breakfast as usual, and wait for you.
Here is the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The box was larger than one might think from the outside, and
already heavy with the perfume of flowers.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">10</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PRELUDE TO THE SERVANTS&rsquo; BALL</span></h2>
<p>Under the colored lanterns swinging from trees, there were already
a score or more carriages lining the side drives. Coachmasters
talked in groups. The doors of the hall stood open, a wide bar of
light silhouetting those who came on foot from the opera-hall, and
turning to a more vivid green the tender grass. Violins sounded
piercingly; as Rodvard joined the throng at the entrance, striving
to walk with Cleudi&rsquo;s slight strut, he saw how all the floor beyond
was covered with jewels and flashing feet, while nearby the mingled
voices were so high that only the rhythm of the music was
audible, with women&rsquo;s laughter riding on all like a foam. Right behind
him a bearded Prophet of Mancherei showed the slim legs of
a girl through an artfully torn silken robe, and tossed at him a
rouge-ball which marked his white jacket; he must weave his way
to the foot of the stairs around a group gaily trying with tinsel
swords to attack an armored capellan, pausing to bow before one
of twenty queens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>Halfway up the stairs in the dim of the balustrade, an archer of
the guard, with his star-badge picked out in emeralds, was kissing
a sea-witch in flowing blue. They disembraced at his footfalls; the
sea-girl leaped up and threw her arms around Rodvard&rsquo;s neck, crying;
&ldquo;Snowlord from Kjermanash, I will melt you. Did I not tell
you, ser archer, that witches are all fickle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are tamed by those who battle for them,&rdquo; said the archer,
as Rodvard gave her the kiss she sought. (Behind her eyes was nothing
but reckless pleasure.) &ldquo;My lord of Kjermanash, I challenge
you; will you duel or die for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie!&rdquo; cried the sea-girl. &ldquo;No one shall ever tame me,&rdquo; and
giving them each a box on the ear in a single motion, ran lightfoot
and laughing down the steps to throw herself on the capellan,
shouting that he was her prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost! Lost!&rdquo; cried the archer in mock agony. &ldquo;Come, my lord,
let us make an alliance for the conquest of witches less fickle than
the marine. I will provide the arm and you the purse, from that
secret gold-mine which all Kjermanash keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ser archer, it is magic gold, and at the touch of a witch,
would vanish.&rdquo; Rodvard bowed and turned up the stairs.</p>
<p>For most, it was still too early to retire to the boxes, the corridor
behind them was empty of all but one small group of masks, laughing
together. Rodvard waited a moment with beating heart, turning
to toss one of his snowballs of perfumed fabric at random into the
crowd below. He thought someone down there in the group might
have cried, &ldquo;Cleudi!&rdquo; as the people at the end of the corridor entered
their box and he was alone. The handkerchief was in place;
it was more than a little dim for him to be sure of the color, but
as he took it from its place with a little tear, there could be no doubt
that the perfume was rose.</p>
<p>Eight paces counted in automatic nervousness carried him to the
door of Cleudi&rsquo;s box. Music and voices were muted from within, it
was an island of alone, the feeling deepened by everything in view.
Other servants than Damaris had been busy; the reek of flowers
was heavier than ever, even the chairs were garlanded and the odor
enhanced by a tall candle which stood on the sideboard, left of the
entrance, sending a tiny curl of perfumed smoke into the still air.
Around the candle were viands; beyond the sideboard against the
wall, a divan with rolling edges; round chairs facing the panels
where the box would look out over the dancing floor if the panels
were let down and the curtains drawn back. There were two chairs
facing the table and it was laid, but in the center, only the bottle
of fired-wine, its cork already drawn. Rodvard poured himself a
dram and drank it rapidly, savoring the warm shock as it coursed
down his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>He wondered if he dared take a second draft and decided
against, he would need clear wits to play his part. A slice from the
ham made him realize hunger, but again he forebore to go further,
it would be ungentle to disarrange the meal before the arrival of
his guest. He walked slowly across and seated himself in one of
the chairs, looking outward toward the blank paneling, twisting his
back into the comfort of the seat, but without finding rest. From
below the high note of a violin in crescendo pierced the hangings;
one might be one of those gods of antique legend, who sit on the
Shining Mountains, with heads above the clouds, and control mortal
destinies to whom all below would be what he heard now, a babble
with an occasional note of agony. Ah, but to be the controller instead
of the controlled&mdash;</p>
<p>The door was tapped.</p>
<p>So rapidly that the chair was overset, Rodvard leaped to his
feet, picked it up, cursing his clumsiness, strode swiftly to the door
and threw it open. On the threshold stood the Prophet of Mancherei,
who had teased him with the rouge-ball. He bowed over her hand,
drawing her in, and as the door closed, declaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now that winter&rsquo;s gone, the earth has lost</p>
<p class="t0">Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost</p>
<p class="t0">Candies the grass or casts an icy cream</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the silver lake or crystal stream;</p>
<p class="t0">Now do the choir of chirping minstrels bring</p>
<p class="t0">In triumph to the world the youthful spring:</p>
<p class="t0">The valleys, woods and hills in rich array</p>
<p class="t0">Welcome the coming of the longed-for May.</p>
<p class="t0">Now all things smile, only my love doth lower</p>
<p class="t0">Nor hath the scalding noon-day sun the power</p>
<p class="t0">To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold</p>
<p class="t0">Her heart congealed and makes her pity cold.</p>
<p class="t0">How shall we call it spring when she doth carry</p>
<p class="t0">June in her eyes, in her heart January?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;in a half-whisper, yet joyously, with laughing lips, as Cleudi
might have done it, passing one hand around her shoulders, with
the other holding tight to her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A northern lord to complain of the cold? And to instruct the
Prophet of Love in love?&rdquo; she said, in Countess Aiella&rsquo;s thrilling
voice. (If it were only this one.) &ldquo;I will not grant your right to sue
until you have proved love your prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that would be epicene,&rdquo; said Rodvard (the fired-wine working
in him; but it was too dim to wring truth from her eyes). &ldquo;You
must convert yourself to a woman before you can convert me to
your sacred love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, love does not remain true love when its longings are satisfied;
therefore the sacred, which can never be satisfied, is above the
profane,&rdquo; she said, stepping to one of the chairs at the table with a
graceful play of ankle. Her hands went up to slip off the head-mask,
and she sat back, hair falling round her shoulders. &ldquo;I am a little
weary, my lord of Kjermanash; give me something to drink that
will warm your wintry wit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers toyed with a goblet, but he took one of the festival-cups
from his belt, poured it full, then as she drank, disengaged it
from her fingers and finished it himself, lips carefully at the place
where hers had touched the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not worthy of you, my lord. Is this the promised originality?
Go catch servant-girls with such tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he said, using the same half-whisper (the voice was the
danger-point). &ldquo;True love and longing has no tricks, only the expression
by every means of its desire. Let us contest your heresy
that satisfied longing is the end of love; for in love, the momentary
assuagement only leads to further longings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured her more from the bottle, and this time took the
other cup himself. (The glint of her eye, momentarily caught, held
some slight anticipation of pleasure, but there was more in it of
weariness with the world.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if it only would,&rdquo; she said, and turned her lovely head
aside. &ldquo;I am hungry, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped up at once and began to serve her from the sideboard,
while the joyous tumult from below and along the corridor
became louder, and someone in the next box was making high festival,
with squeals of women laughing and the rumble of men. They
ate, talking a little more of the nature of love and whether it lives
by satisfaction or by the lack of it. She drank more than he. There
were springcakes; he set one before her, but she only tasted it and
pushed it away, whereupon he left his own untouched and ran
around the table to gather her in his arms. &ldquo;You are the only sweet
I need,&rdquo; he whispered, feeling at once strong and weak, but she
avoided her head from his kiss, and when he essayed to hold her,
shook herself free, with: &ldquo;No. Ah, let us not spoil it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely Aiella, do not say that, I implore,&rdquo; he cried, slipping
down with one arm around her waist, his face close to the sweet
hair of her turned head (and now with the fired-wine and nearness
it was not of Maritzl of Stojenrosek he thought of, Maritzl lost, or
of Lalette, or of the interruption that would come, but only of
desire), and he slipped farther to one knee, not saying anything any
more, only drawing her hands to him and kissing them again and
again.</p>
<p>She took them from him and lifted his face gently to look him
straight in the eyes, for one long breath in which the sound of
the twittering recorders came from the floor beneath; then the
Countess Aiella rose a trifle unsteadily to her feet, and as Rodvard
rose also, holding her in the circle of his arms, said; &ldquo;Shall we
kiss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face was in shadow as the full lips met his, but as he
swung her from her feet toward the divan, her eyes came open
(and he saw in those deep pools that she would resist no longer,
only hope that it would be better than the others). He half fell
across her, with fingers and lips they devoured each other&mdash;</p>
<p>The creak of the opening door shivered through every muscle.
&ldquo;Be careful, my lord,&rdquo; said Cleudi&rsquo;s voice, strongly. &ldquo;By the
Service! What&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard rolled himself afoot (the thought of that other union
unconsummated in Mme. Kaja&rsquo;s garret shouting a trumpet through
his mind and making him now glad, glad of this failure) and
around to see Cleudi, all in his purple costume, with the pudgy
Duke of Aggermans, and between the two a masque dressed as
a bear. The man was very drunk; as the lolling white head came
upright in its swing, Rodvard found himself looking into the
eyes of the people&rsquo;s friend, Baron Brunivar, and even in the dim
light, was appalled by what he saw there, for the man was not
only drunk, he had a witchery upon him.</p>
<p>The mouth opened. &ldquo;Sh&rsquo; my always darling,&rdquo; said Brunivar
thickly, and disengaging his arm from Cleudi&rsquo;s, swung it in a
round gesture. &ldquo;Glad you foun&rsquo; her for me.&rdquo; Aggermans released
the other arm; the Baron took three stumbling steps toward Aiella,
and as she slipped his clutch, stumbled onto the divan, pushed
himself around, focussed his eyes with difficulty, and cried; &ldquo;Now
I foun&rsquo; her. Festival night. You go leave us, and I do anything
you want tomorrow, my lor&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aggermans&rsquo; round face had gone cherry-red. &ldquo;That I can credit,
my lord,&rdquo; he said, looking steadily not at Brunivar but at the
Countess Aiella. &ldquo;The more since I once would have done the
same. But it is too high a price for the temporary favors of a
bona roba.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>The Countess laughed. &ldquo;The pleasure of your Grace&rsquo;s company
has been so small that you must not blame me if I seek
elsewhere.&rdquo; She turned to Cleudi with a certain dignity. &ldquo;As for
you, my lord, I know whom I have to thank for this shame, and
believe me, I will not forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed. &ldquo;If the memory lasts until the next time when you
laugh over having given a rendezvous you never meant to keep,
I shall feel myself repaid for my troubles,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she has been deceiving you, too?&rdquo; said Aggermans, and
turned toward Rodvard as Brunivar made one more pawing effort
to grasp the girl. &ldquo;And who is this? I think I should like to
remember him.&rdquo; (Concentrated venom streamed from his eyes.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, since this is another costume of mine, I think this will
be my writer,&rdquo; said Cleudi. &ldquo;Take off your mask, Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard drew it off slowly, not knowing what to say, but the
Countess Aiella spared him the trouble. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was
all planned, not a part only. At least he has a heart, and so the
advantage over any of you.&rdquo; She stepped over to take the young
man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Ser, will you escort me as far as my pavilion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleudi stepped aside to let them pass through the door and
down the stairs. &ldquo;What, unmasked already, my lady?&rdquo; cried someone
in the gay crowd round the door, but she did not turn her
head until they were out in the shadow, when she released his
arm with; &ldquo;Now, go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From within the hall came the moan of violins.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>He woke with scaly tongue, head spinning in the fumes of
the fired-wine and body burning with unfulfilled desires, to the
clink of silver on porcelain, as the maid Damaris bore in his breakfast
tray. She was already in costume, a milkmaid and not badly
done; her eyes and feet were dancing. &ldquo;Oh, where did you get the
lovely Kjermanash mask?&rdquo; she asked as he propped himself up
among the pillows, and giving him the tray, went to run her
fingers lovingly over the white silk where it hung across the
chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the most beautiful thing ever. I&rsquo;ll be so happy to
be with you in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count Cleudi lent it to me . . . Damaris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down a minute. On the chair, no matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ruffle your beautiful costume. Was it made in Kjermanash?&rdquo;
She sat facing him on the bed as he moved over to make room.
The neck of her milkmaid&rsquo;s dress was cut low enough to show the
upper round of her breasts with a little in between (and the
Blue Star told him that she noticed, and wanted him to notice; that
it was festival day, when all&rsquo;s forgotten in the new spring).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damaris&mdash;about this ball . . . I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to
go with you after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather than angry, her face was woebegone to the edge of
tears. (A world was crashing in her thoughts.) &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to
be with servant-class people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached out and patted her hand conciliatingly. &ldquo;Of course
I do, with you. But Damaris . . . you said it cost three spadas
and I haven&rsquo;t hardly any coppers, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She perched her head on one side and looked at him
birdlike under prettily arched brows. &ldquo;I can let you have that
much.&rdquo; Then, seeing the expression on his face; &ldquo;You can give
it back to me when you get it from your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He did not really want to go at all, headache and the thought
of his position with Cleudi and the Duke of Aggermans gnawed
at him, he could not think clearly.) &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to take your money. I may&mdash;may not get any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered, looking at him sharply, with eyes narrowing.
Then; &ldquo;I know. You don&rsquo;t want to go with me because I&rsquo;m not
your friend.&rdquo; She tipped suddenly forward, one arm round his
neck, and kissed him hard, then drew her head back, and with a
long breath, said; &ldquo;Will you go with me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed him again, tonguewise, and as her lips clung, shifted
her body, and with her free hand, guided his to the V of her
dress. Her eyes said she did not want him to stop, and he did
not. Near the end it came to him that the Blue Star was dead,
he could not fathom a single thought in her mind.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">KAZMERGA; TWO AGAINST A WORLD</span></h2>
<p>Mathurin entered on his almost soundless feet and let the door
close behind him in the dark before saying, &ldquo;Rodvard,&rdquo; softly. Rodvard,
who had been letting his mind drift along endless alleys
rather than thinking, swung himself up. &ldquo;I will make a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not. There is danger enough, and its point would so be
sharpened. Do not even speak aloud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Aggermans. His bravoes are let loose. No time. I
only just now learned it from the Count.&rdquo; Outside there was the
soft sighing of rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once. Make your way south, to the Center of Sedad Mir. The
contact is a wool-dealer named St&uuml;ndert, in the second dock street.
Can you remember? Change clothes with me quickly. Do not even
take the door, which is watched, but go by the window, across the
road, and south into the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serving-man began to undress in the dark; Rodvard recognized
the sound. &ldquo;Is there any money?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The rustling stopped. &ldquo;You to need money, who have the Blue
Star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even under the dark, Rodvard felt himself flush (did he dare
tell what had happened? No.). &ldquo;Still, I will need some small amount.
I have nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even under his breath Rodvard could catch the fury in the
other&rsquo;s tone; &ldquo;Ah, you deserve to have your bones broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; but is there any money?&rdquo; Rodvard fumbled for the
unfamiliar lace-points.</p>
<p>The man snarled, but pressed a few coins into his grasp. &ldquo;You
are to regard this as a loan. Cleudi sends it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. You did not tell me he was aiding this escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants you to go south to Tritulacca, and gave me a letter
for you to carry&mdash;which I will transmit to the High Center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might be a girl&rsquo;s light tap at the door. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; whispered
Mathurin, fiercely.</p>
<p>The window swung wide; Rodvard felt rain on his face, and the
mud of the flower-bed squished round Mathurin&rsquo;s soft shoes as he
took the leap down. A light flamed up in the room behind him; he
began to run, stumbling up the terraces with branches snatching
at his body, zigzagging to avoid the pennon of light. A voice
shouted across the rain after him (and he thought Mathurin was
a mighty bold fellow to face the Duke of Aggermans&rsquo; assassins back
there). He came against a hedge; there was another shout and the
sound of crashing footsteps from the left, in which direction the
hedge ran, no way to turn, and he stumbled over a root, prone, to
roll beneath the lip of the shrubbery, thinking concealment might
be a better resource than speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>So it was; shout echoed shout with an accent of lost, footsteps
went past, but apparently no one had a light and before one could
be brought, Rodvard rolled out, and began to work cautiously
toward the end of the hedge, bending double. The bushes turned
back to enclose a square of garden, but there was a locked gate,
low enough to be climbed. Over; the gravel path beyond, for a
wonder, did not run circular like most, from which he deduced that
it must be the one leading down from the main road. It offered the
only real clue to direction, for the lights had winked out back there,
the villa&rsquo;s mass and the trees cut off the night-shine from the bay,
and the slope was no help at all with everything so gardened.
Rodvard pushed forward cautiously; presently the feel of ruts under
his feet told him his reasoning was sound, and he paused to consider
whether along the road or across it. The second alternative
won; if Aggermans were so in earnest, his people would not give
up easily, and they would likely spread along the road.</p>
<p>There was no hedge at the opposite side, but a narrow ditch, in
which Rodvard got one leg well wetted to the knee and almost
fell. Beyond a slope pitched upward into what, as nearly as he
could make out by feeling, would be a sapling grove with low underbrush.
Having no cloak, he was by this time so wet that it did
not matter when he stumbled against small trunks and the leaves
just bursting above deluged him with big drops, but the sensation
was so unpleasant that it tipped him into a despairing mood, where
his fatigues of the night and day rolled in (and he began to ask
himself whether all pleasures must end in an escape of some kind).
So he followed the pent of the hill blindly, not thinking at all
of where he was going (but only of how he was trapped by unfairnesses
somewhere; and that it could not be altogether a matter of
man&rsquo;s justice, which was the plainder of the Sons of the New Day,
since no justice of man&rsquo;s would hold men from fiery passion).</p>
<p>Beyond an easy crest there was a dip, and Rodvard hurt his
knee against a wall of piled stone. In the field beyond, he could
sense under his feet the stumps of last year&rsquo;s corn, he was sick with
weariness and fear and had begun to sneeze; there was no light or
life in the world. What direction? With no reason for any, he followed
the line of the stone wall for a little time, and it brought
him ultimately to a sodden straw-stack, whose hard surface yielded
just enough to the persistence of his fingers so that he could get
the upper half of his body in and slide down into unhappy sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>He woke with a headache at the top of his spine, which ran
around inside his head to the place over his eyes; nose feeling as
though driven with a wooden plug. Mathurin&rsquo;s decent black clothes
were horribly stained and scratched. Down the way he had come&mdash;not
at all far from where he had crossed the wall, now that one
could see by the light of morning&mdash;the footprints lay, a fingerlength
deep into the soft ground. At once he was oppressed by the thought
that only too easily could his path from the villa be traced, there
was Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s witch behind as well, and fear mounting over the illness,
he climbed to the wall itself and tried to walk along its top
to hide his marks. After the rain, sky and air had become clear, and
there were violets visible on the grove-side of the wall, not that
they did him any joy in his misery. The stones quickly tore a hole in
shoes made for indoor walking, so he had to jump down again and
consider.</p>
<p>Right across his direction, at a little distance, there jutted out
from the stone wall a hedge which lack of care had let grow into
a screen of low, sprawling trees. It slanted down leftward to where
a gap would mark a field entrance; beyond, a slow trickle of smoke
ran up the blue to signal breakfast. Rodvard, deciding what he
would do if he were hunter instead of hunted, found more than
good the argument against harborage so near the villa. He climbed
over the wall again to wipe his streaming nose with a burdock leaf,
whose bitter juice stung his lips, and perceiving that he left less
marked traces in the ground on that side, stayed. The overgrown
hedge proved to line a deep-cut track that in one direction wound
down toward the main road past the villa. Beyond that track was
true forest of old trunks and heavy underbrush. It was surely a good
place to seek concealment, but Rodvard was ignorant of how far
it might run or what it led to, and with illness galloping through
his veins, felt he must have shelter early, so murmuring half aloud
to himself that he might as well die in hot blood as in cold rheum,
he turned up the track toward the cottage-smoke.</p>
<p>The building was more prosperous than most in the country,
with a barn outside, and two complete windows under the thatch-edge.
No one answered his knock; as he pushed open the door, a
child&rsquo;s squall was sounding with irritable monotony from a
trundle-bed on the right, and a woman who had been doing something
at a table before the fireplace on the left turned to face him.
She was bent and dirty; her face was older than her figure. &ldquo;What
do you want?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place to rest, if I can,&rdquo; said Rodvard, &ldquo;and perhaps something
to eat.&rdquo; He crossed the room and came down weak-kneed on
a stool by the fireplace corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>The lined face held no sympathy as her eyes swept down the
detail of his torn, mudstained clothes and lingered for a tick at
the servant&rsquo;s badge on his breast. &ldquo;This is not an inn,&rdquo; she said
sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I am unwell. I can pay.&rdquo; He fumbled at the waist-pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not an inn,&rdquo; she repeated, then spun on her heel, took
rapid steps to where the child in its bed still bawled, and administered
it a severe clout on the side of the head. &ldquo;Will you be quiet?&rdquo;
The cries sank to whimpers. She came to stand looking down at
Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know about your kind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too lazy to work,
so you run away from a good master down there at the villa and
probably rob him, too, on festival day when he&rsquo;s drunk, and then
expect honest country-people like us, who have to labor for everything
we get, to hide you from the provosts. My husband and me,
we have to get up at dawn and work all day as hard as we can,
and we&rsquo;re never through till the sun goes down, winter or summer,
while you servant-people are drinking and stealing behind your
master&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; All this was delivered in a torrent as though it were
a single sentence, ending as she uplifted one arm to brandish an
imaginary weapon. &ldquo;Now you leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too weary and ill for a reply, a trickle he did not try to disguise
running from his nostril, Rodvard did so, out into the bright
spring day and along the track. Where it turned round a boss of
hill that thrust in from the westward, a sense of being watched
made him look back. The farm-wife had come out to the end of
the house to look after him, and the sound of the child&rsquo;s petulant
wail was on the air. (Rodvard felt a surge of bitter anger; there
was an unfairness in life, every pennyweight of pleasure is paid
with double its measure in pain, and only those who grubbed at the
ground were entitled to call themselves honest. Why, if this be so,
then joy must be wrong, and God himself must be evil, in spite of
what the priests say.) But his head was too muzzy to follow any
rabbit of reasoning to its hole, so he trudged along for a while without
thinking anything at all, until he heard the creak of a cart, and
here was a mule coming out from the Sedad Vix direction. The
driver somewhat surlily gave him the time of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Rodvard asked to go with him, and when the man said he was
bound for Kazmerga, declared that was his destination, though he
had never heard of the place and possessed not the least idea in
what direction it lay. The fellow grunted and let him climb in; sat
silent for a while as Rodvard sneezed and drizzled, then was moved
to remark that this was a heavy case of the phlegm, but it could
be cured by an infusion of dandelion root with certain drugs, such
as his old woman made, and so well that they often accused her
of being a witch. &ldquo;&mdash;But the drugs are costly now.&rdquo; He evidently
wanted conversation in payment for his favor, and when this beginning
failed on Rodvard&rsquo;s merely remarking that he would pay
for any quantity of drugs to get rid of this rheum, fell silent for a
couple of minutes; then leaned over, touched the servant&rsquo;s badge,
and struck out again with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running away, ey? What happened, ey? Lying with wrong
woman on festival night, perhaps? Ah, there&rsquo;s many and many a
high family has daughters born nine months from festival night
that shouldn&rsquo;t rightly inherit, but lord, young man, don&rsquo;t you run
away because of that. I say to you that ladies can forgive and be
forgive for everything they do that night, when all&rsquo;s free, and I say
to you, you ought to go back to your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled and waved his mule-goad. &ldquo;I do recall, I do, when
I was a sprout no older than yourself how one night I went all the
way to Masjon for spring festival and at the dancing in the square
there, I found a little cat as hot as ever could be, so we slipped
away for some conversation, ey? And when I got back to where I
was staying with a friend, what do you think I found? Why, in my
bed there was his sister&mdash;Phidera, that was her name&mdash;and she was
saying she had thought the bed her own, and no more clothes on
her than a fish. So there were two of them in one night, all I could
do, he, he, he, and that&rsquo;s the way it always is at spring festival,
and maybe it would be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Rodvard, and the latter was glad for once that
the Blue Star had gone dumb over his heart, for there was a drop
of moisture on the lip above the ill-shaven chin, which the gaffer
did not bother to suck in or to wipe away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing like that,&rdquo; said he (and to keep from being
drawn deeper into the morass of the old fellow&rsquo;s thinking); &ldquo;Have
you heard that Baron Brunivar is like to be decreed in accusation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ey, ey. Those westerners, half Mayerns they are. It will be a
sad day when the snow melts from Her Majesty&rsquo;s head, with only
the regents between that crazy Pavinius and the throne, and no
female heirs. Ey, ey. Here we are in the Marquis of Deschera&rsquo;s
seignory. For you servant-class it is no matter; you lay out the
plates on the table and you have a scuderius in your hand, but
for us farm-people with all the taxes . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>(&ldquo;I am not a servant,&rdquo; Rodvard wanted to cry, &ldquo;but a clerk who
makes his gain as hard as you; and it is you we most wish to help.&rdquo;
But he forebore), saying only; &ldquo;Is there an inn at Kazmerga? I
need something to eat, being without breakfast, and a place to lie
down for the cure of my fluxions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tavern&mdash;&rdquo; the man stopped, and the expression above the
uncut whisker became crafty (so that now Rodvard longed for the
Blue Star); &ldquo;Would you pay an innkeeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I have a little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be letting me take you to my home. The old woman will
arrange your fluxions in less than a minute with her specific if you
pay for it, and give all else you need for less than half what an
innkeeper would ask, and no questions if the provosts come nosing,
ey. Go, Mironelle.&rdquo; He leaned forward and rammed the goad into
the mule&rsquo;s rump, which shook its ears, danced a little with the hind
feet, and began to trot, so that Rodvard&rsquo;s aching head jounced
agonizingly. There was a turn, the track was broadening, fields
showed, pigs rooted contentedly in a ditch, and the trees gave back
to show a church with its half-moon symbol at the peak, and
around it, like the spoke of a wheel, houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kazmerga,&rdquo; said the mule-man. &ldquo;I live on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>She was fat and one eye looked off at the wrong angle, but
Rodvard was in a state not to care if she had worn on her brow
the mark of evil. He flopped on the straw-bed. There was only one
window, at the other end; the couple whispered under it, after
which the housewife set a pot on the fire. Rodvard saw a big striped
cat that marched back and forth, back and forth, beside the straw-bed,
and it gave him a sense of nameless unease. The woman paid
no attention, only stirring the pot as she cast in an herb or two, and
muttering to herself.</p>
<p>Curtains came down his eyes, though not that precisely, neither;
he lay in a kind of suspension of life, while the steam of the pot
seemed to spread toward filling the room. Time hung; then the potion
must be ready, for through half-closed lids Rodvard could see
her lurch toward him in a manner somewhat odd. Yet it was not
till she reached the very side of the bed and lifted his head in the
crook of one arm, while pressing toward his lips the small earthen
bowl, that a tired mind realized he should not from his position
have been able to see her at all. A mystery; the pendulous face
opened on gapped teeth; &ldquo;Take it now my prettyboy, take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>The liquid was hot and very bitter on the lips, but as the first
drops touched Rodvard&rsquo;s tongue, the cat in the background emitted
a scream that cut like a rusty saw. The woman jerked violently,
spilling the stuff so it scalded him all down chin and chest as she
let go. She swung round, squawking something that sounded like
&ldquo;Pozekshus!&rdquo; at the animal. Rodvard struggled desperately as in a
nightmare, unable to move a muscle no more than if he had been
carved out of stone, realizing horribly that he had been bewitched.
He wanted to vomit and could not; the cottage-wife turned back
toward him with an expression little beautiful.</p>
<p>Her grubby hands were shaking a little. She grumbled under
her breath as he felt her detach the belt-pouch with all his money
and then slip off his shoes. The jacket came next; but as she undid
the laces at the top, grunting and puffing, her hand touched the
chain that held the Blue Star, and she jerked out the jewel. In all
his immobility Rodvard&rsquo;s every perception had become as painfully
sharp as an edge of broken ice. He thought she was going to
have a fit, her features seemed to twist and melt into each other,
her hand came away from the stone as though it had been a red
coal. &ldquo;Oh, nonononono,&rdquo; she squealed, backing away. &ldquo;No. No. No.
Ah, you were right, Tigrette; you were right to stop me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cat arched against her. As though the small act had released
some spring in herself, the woman bustled to the invisible
end of the room, where Rodvard could hear wood click on earthenware,
then some kind of a dumb low-toned chant she raised, then
became aware of a different and aromatic odor. He was wide awake
now and hardly sick at all any more; could see how the mist in the
room was clearing a little, then heard the door creak open and the
mule-driver&rsquo;s voice, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get it done, ey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, you old fool, you rat-pudding, you dog-bait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool yourself.&rdquo; Rodvard heard the sound of a slap. &ldquo;Call
me old fool. You weren&rsquo;t so dainty with the last one. Taken with
the pretty lad, are you? Now go do it, or I&rsquo;ll slice his throat myself
and never mind mess. What&rsquo;s one runaway servant more or less,
ey? This is real money, hard money, more nor you ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she was whimpering. &ldquo;I tell you you&rsquo;re a fool. He has a
Blue Star, a Blue Star, and his witch will know what&rsquo;s put on him
and recoil it back to us, double, triple. Worms that never die crawling
under your skin till you perish of it. All the hard money there
is is not worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound of steps. The scratchy face looked down at Rodvard, he
felt the man palm the jewel. &ldquo;Blue Star, ey? Ah, fritzess, this is
some piece of glass.&rdquo; But the tone was little sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a Blue Star and nothing else, the second one I see. They
are wedded with the great wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>The man turned, and though his own head did not, Rodvard
could see how the expression of craftiness had come on back to
him. &ldquo;Blue Star? Now you witch it for him, wife, witch it for him,
so it will be no longer good. You can witch anything. Then I&rsquo;ll
take him away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whimper became a sniffle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll witch, ah, I&rsquo;ll witch, mumble,
mumble, mumble.&rdquo; Rodvard heard her tottering shuffle go and
come, the fat face was over his again, all filled now with oily kinks
that held little beads of sweat. She looked at him closely and then
flung over her shoulder; &ldquo;Go out, old man, and leave us. There&rsquo;s
something not healthy for you to see,&rdquo; and began plucking at her
garments to undo them, at the last moment pausing to throw an
edge of stinking blanket over Rodvard&rsquo;s face. His heightened senses
caught the stiff rustle of clothes sinking to the floor; the aromatic
smell declared itself over all others, her fingers sought his burned
chin beneath the blanket and applied a relieving unguent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumble, mumble,&rdquo; came her voice, and he understanding not
a word. &ldquo;Meowrrr-row!&rdquo; shouted the cat, as it raced through the
narrow cot from end to end. He could have melted with relief as
the fingers soothed his chest, but then his mind went off on a picture
of Lalette become old in the manner of this one and he would
have shuddered if he could have stirred. The crooning mumble
ended, the witch-wife&rsquo;s ministrations at the same time. There was
a silence set with small sounds, over which the continued mewling
of the cat. He heard the woman at the door summon her husband,
then the two of them speaking in voiceless sibilants, a contention
going on, which terminated with the man&rsquo;s strong arms around
Rodvard, heaving him up like a sack of meal.</p>
<p>Exterior air came through the edge of the blanket; step, step,
he was borne, and with a grunt, dumped in what must be the
mule-cart. A pause; the blanket was twitched from his face and he
was looking up into the disparate eyes of the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice boy, nice boy,&rdquo; said her voice. &ldquo;You tell your witch now
how I do good. You tell her I respect the great wedding. Not him;
he keeps your hard money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She patted his still unmoving cheek, a touch that made his
senses creep; and the Blue Star was suddenly, shockingly cold over
his heart, (he could see beyond any question that there was in the
woman&rsquo;s mind a great fear, but also the great longing kindness of
two joined against an arm&egrave;d world).</p>
<p>From where he was leading the mule to hitching, the man&rsquo;s
voice came; &ldquo;Wife, get that badge we took from the last one, the
mechanician. I say to you, you hurry now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">12</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NETZNEGON CITY; A ZIGRANER FESTIVAL</span></h2>
<p>After he had gone, Lalette cried a little, but the widow pretended
not to notice, busying herself with sewing on one of the
festival masks, a task at which the girl was presently helping, so
far as she could, for she was no great artist with the needle, nor
wished to be. When they began talking again it was about the
robe they were working on, grey silk velvet which had been artfully
torn here and there to a pretense of raggedness, through
which the slashes were being backed with flame-color. Lalette
passed her hands across the lovely fabric (longing to be gay and
courted in such a gown, though it left so much of the leg bare that
she would have felt a little shame to wear it). Who was it made
for?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Countess Aiella of Arjen, for the festival ball at Sedad
Vix. The younger Countess, that is, the unmarried one. I designed
it especially for her. The mask is there.&rdquo; She nodded.</p>
<p>It hung on one of the standards, empty of eye and mouth, but
no one could mistake the provenance of the high-bridged nose and
the cheekbones from which the full rumpled beard flowed down.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Lalette, &ldquo;it is Prince Pavinius when he was Prophet of
Mancherei; I thought you were&mdash;&rdquo; and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amorosians?&rdquo; The widow Domijaiek smiled. &ldquo;I am a follower
of that doctrine, though not yet perfected in it. But in spite of
what you have been told, it is not one of gloomy reverence. It does
not prohibit joy, nor even keep us away from the world, only declares
that the joys of the world are false beside those that come to
us when we learn how we have been deceived by the flesh. You,
who are newly married, have the other kind of love now, and will
not know what I mean, but in the end you will come to see that
kind of love as sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not married,&rdquo; said Lalette, letting her needle fall (but
doubting that her feeling toward Rodvard were indeed the love the
poets carolled, and of which Dame Domijaiek spoke), &ldquo;except in
what we who have the Art call the great marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>&ldquo;I would as soon not speak as to that,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;but in
our church we are taught that to love a person is to love the world,
which is a deception due to the God of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Rodvard did not come back that evening, nor the next, and no
word from him of any kind. Lalette felt unhappy and listless after
so long indoors; above her she could hear from time to time Mme.
Kaja&rsquo;s footsteps come and go, and when the door was opened,
often one of her pupils in song, flatted usually and more frequently
than not, off key. The boy Laduis soon held little more for her,
and in any case with the spring festival now rushing on so fast,
had to be taken from his academy to run errands for his mother,
who now worked late every night. The widow said the court had
gone down to Sedad Vix, the doubled guards at the city gates were
withdrawn, and the provosts somewhat relaxing in vigilance as to
their search for the girl.</p>
<p>It might be safe to leave her refuge, if she had any place to go.
Surely, not to her mother&rsquo;s, who would still be watched by Uncle
Bontembi the priest if by no other, and it seemed to Lalette there
was no friend of her own age near enough to be trusted, now that
all the world knew her for a witch. It was a box. For the present,
one was able to pay in some sort for food and shelter by labor on
the festival costumes, but that would soon be done. Ah, Rodvard,
are you detained or faithless&mdash;which? She wished him there before
her for an explanation that would also be the clue to her new life;
and asked herself why a partnership of half an hour and not altogether
of her own will, should bind her for life. Hold him she
thought she could, and though hating the dependency into which
she was thrown, hating the bond that made dependency her
only resort, there was nothing to do but go see Dr. Remigorius,
knowing that man hated her, and through him, try to find her
lover. Oh, if I could ever be my own, not my mother&rsquo;s nor any his,
she wished desperately, and though not a word of this was put
into voice, the widow seemed to know her whole mind when Lalette
said she thought it might be worth going forth on festival eve
to seek tidings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You will want the mask of the Kjermanash princess,
the one that Laduis calls Sunimaa. I will let you take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said at this time, nor until the afternoon of
the festival eve itself, with horns and whistles already blowing in
the street, though the sun had not yet touched the arm of spring,
when the widow helped her into the fur-tipped robe, surveyed her
all round, and bade farewell with a smile (which Lalette thought
a trifle sad). &ldquo;If all does not go as you would wish, return here. You
may at all times come in the name of the God of love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>It was just falling twilight when Lalette felt stones under her
feet again and breathed deep the fine air of spring. Someone had
hung a pair of colored lanterns at the gate of the Street Cossao, one
of them with a broken pane in its side, through which the candle
within shed its beam on a group of three or four premature revellers
gathered round a bottle. They hallooed to Lalette and began
to follow her along the boulevard on uneasy legs, but gave it up
when she saw a hired carriage come past empty and hailed it as if
to mount. When she did not after all enter his vehicle, the carriage-master
swore at her, but want of money to pay left her without
choice.</p>
<p>At the market-place tables had been set out and musicians on
a stand surrounded with flowers and green branches were already
intoning the volalelle, but only three or four couples were dancing.
There were some murmurs of appreciation for her costume from
those sitting; none called nor gave her any sign. It was a poor district;
she knew she must look by the half too lordly, and that was
as well.</p>
<p>Some way farther along, a group all masked was holding a procession
from a side-street behind a hand-drum, and laughingly
begged her to join, but she pulled loose. The sound of bells began
to hang over the gay din that rose from the city, and Lalette hurried,
feeling more than ever out of protection and alone. The street
where Remigorius had his shop was wider than her memory of it.
Someone had affixed an absurd green paper ribbon to the neck of
the stuffed lizard over the door, but all seemed dark within.</p>
<p>There was no answer when Lalette pulled at the bell. Her heart
plunged down into dreadful syncope&mdash;Oh, what will I do without
money if he is not there nor anyone? Not go back to that woman
of strange gods, no. She rang again, twice, to make her insistence
clear, and as someone down the street greeted guests with a glad
shout of welcome, the door cracked open and a voice said that the
doctor was abroad, not even in Netznegon City, but there was
another medic around the corner and two stories aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Lalette, &ldquo;it is not for the curative that I wished him.
I desire to find a friend of his and mine&mdash;Rodvard Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Door came fully open. In the rapidly fading light the girl found
herself looking at a young man whose chin and slanting eyes betrayed
Zigraner origin. As always with that race, the smile was an
effort to ingratiate, but there was something unpleasant about it.
&ldquo;Are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette Asterhax. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle, will you come in? The doctor has left me to keep
his place for all that concerns the Sons of the New Day, since matters
have reached such a crisis with what has been discovered at
the conference of court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette followed him (with dreadful certainty clutching at her
heart that this was the key, then, of so much she had failed to understand;
Rodvard was an intimate of that gang of murderous
conspirators and so must these others be.) The Zigraner indicated
a stool in the shop and struck a light. &ldquo;You permit that I introduce
myself? I am Gaidu Pyax. Of Rodvard you should not be concerned.
He is doing good work, and the High Center has forwarded
to ours its praise of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I am planets and centuries away from the man who has chosen
me, she thought. How can I say it? What shall I ask?) &ldquo;There was
no word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Zigraner frowned. &ldquo;The sub-leader of your center doubtless
told you of the plot against Baron Brunivar, the regent prospective?
It was Rodvard who uncovered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; (The conversation was going to stop.) She cried desperately;
&ldquo;I thought he would be back with me for the festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have so lovely a costume, demoiselle. Duty bears
hard on us.&rdquo; His smile changed to a little bark of a laugh. &ldquo;But be
tranquil for him; he will sport high with the court at Sedad Vix.&rdquo;
The tongue of Gaidu Pyax came out and made a circle round his
lips; he glanced where the clock ticked against the wall and darted
his eye around quickly. &ldquo;I will see you home, or if you will&mdash;it is
only&mdash;that is&mdash;would you care to see how we Zigraners keep festival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the dark was almost full; the bells were all chiming in
chorus and Rodvard at Sedad Vix. (I have no home, she thought,
and he has sent no word.) &ldquo;It would be pleasant.&rdquo; (For one must
do something.)</p>
<p>Pyax leaped to his feet, his mouth all twisted with joy. &ldquo;Come,
let us go at once. I do not wish to be late for the light.&rdquo; He ran
into the rear room with blundering, skipping steps, tripping at
the doorsill. Lalette heard him stumble and then, in a break of
the street-noises, how a voice in that rear room growled at him
heavily. (Remigorius is there after all, she thought, and maybe
Rodvard; they are lying to me.) Pyax&rsquo; high-pitched voice said; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care if she is a witch. She&rsquo;s going to&mdash;&rdquo; and was cut off by the
long bellow of a horn blown nearby, and he was back, his face
somewhat abashed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>He did not lock the door. In the street the festival was now
full-met, with lights tossing along and the horns blown from every
window under the steady bells. Gaidu Pyax wore only a simple
eye-mask and his voice had a lilt of excitement. Lalette (knew
it was because how all his family would boast of having a true
Dossolan girl to keep festival with, but she) said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you told me that Doctor Remigorius was abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the flickering light, his eyes were sidelong. &ldquo;He is; he truly
is, demoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that not his voice I heard in the rear room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, that was one of our people for whom the provosts
are searching, and it is your fault in a way, because he had to
eliminate the doorman at Rodvard&rsquo;s house, who recognized you&mdash;&rdquo;
How much further he would have carried the useless lie she did
not know or care, for at that moment a girl in a passing group
threw a scent-ball that struck him in the face.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>There was a high hall of entry with upholstered chairs, whose
members were tortured spirals of wood; and a pair of gigantic
silver candlesticks from the floor, rhinanthus plants in form. A
respectful doorman came to take her furs, but they were only
festival imitations without weight, and she kept them. Pyax said;
&ldquo;At our festival we do not wear masks indoors,&rdquo; so she removed
her headdress, and drew a glance of admiration when he saw the
dark hair flowing across the white. The inner door opened and
a middle-aged man with a grave, kindly face, came out, somewhat
ridiculously caparisoned in the red under-jacket of a general.
Pyax bowed low before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, this is the Demoiselle Asterhax, who has come to keep
spring festival with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little uncertain where the line of politeness lay in a Zigraner
house, she would have curtsied, but he, without showing whether
he recognized her name, took her by the hand, with; &ldquo;The friend
of my son is welcome,&rdquo; and led her in. Beyond the inner door
was a narrow hall hung with glyptics, in which he turned rightward
through a second door, and releasing her, clapped both his
hands together. &ldquo;This is the Demoiselle Asterhax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen or more people, who had been sitting in a room so
dim they were visible only as forms, stood up and chorused, &ldquo;You
are welcome!&rdquo; then sat down again with a rustling of silks. The
senior Pyax took Lalette&rsquo;s hand again and led her round through
the gloom to a chair, where he bowed and placed a finger on his
lips. Gaidu Pyax took the next seat to her own; no one spoke. The
whole place had the strange, almost musty odor that forever hangs
round Zigraners; the sound of the rejoicing city could not penetrate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p>Lalette felt that the arm-pieces of her chair were carved into
animals&rsquo; heads and now turned her attention toward the center
of the room, where a single very weak taper burned on a table of
almost eye-level height before a bronze armillary sphere formed
in interlaced tracery. A clockwork turned the sphere; its parts
flashed dully. In that breathing silence the voice of the elder Pyax
spoke out, deep and almost ominous:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, in our darkness, we who have waited long, and long
hoped, pray you not to turn your face from the children of your
creation and the hope of your glory, but to give us light, light,
that we may surround your throne with our praises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone sobbed in the dim; Lalette&rsquo;s side-glance caught a
glimpse of Gaidu&rsquo;s face buried in his hands. To her, as the older
man went on with his prayer, the scene that might have been
moving became painful and ridiculous&mdash;grown people playing make-believe
like silly children, weeping before a machine that must
unfailingly come to the end expected of it&mdash;while there were true
matters of life and death and love lying unsolved. So watching
the dull repeated gleam from the sphere, she swept into reverie
till sphere and taper reached the term of their movement in a
sharp intake of breath from those around. A tiny runnel of flame
slipped across the base beneath the device, its heart seemed to
split apart, discharging a bright ball of purest fire, which threw
the whole room into color.</p>
<p>At once the people leaped to their feet, and shouting &ldquo;Light!
Light! God sees us!&rdquo; began embracing and congratulating each
other, while servants hurried in to light tall candles. Lalette found
herself in the grip of a woman with a haired mole on her chin,
whose over-ample contours were laced into a costume from one
of the knightly legends. The woman capered up and down as she
talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo; she cried in a high voice. &ldquo;We are so glad
to have you come! Ser Pyax never spends less than a hundred
scudi on his festival! You are the one who witched Count Cleudi,
aren&rsquo;t you? The other two Pyax boys couldn&rsquo;t come for the ceremony,
but they have no sisters, you know. God never fails as the
world turns. You must try some of our Zigraner wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant was at Lalette&rsquo;s side, with the beverage in a huge
silver flagon on a huge silver tray, and Gaidu Pyax was offering
her one of his paired festival-cups, curiously carved, and so heavy
it must be pure gold. &ldquo;My aunt Zanzanna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A dog bit
her when she was a baby and never since has she been able to
control her tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will bite you and drive you madder than I am,&rdquo; replied the
woman with the mole. Lalette looked around over the top of her
cup from wine strongly flavored with resin. Everybody was talking
at once and in all directions, disjointedly. The room was a little
smaller than it had seemed in the dark, but still large, with heavy
hangings worked to tapestry at all the windows and pictures occupying
every fingerspace of wall between. The chair where the
senior Pyax had sat was jewelled around its top. At one end of the
room musicians were setting their instruments in order. Most of
the people were approaching middle age and were of a strongly
Zigraner cast of countenance, but there was one girl of surprising
loveliness, blonde enough to be a Kjermanash. The man with her
did not look like one of these people either.</p>
<p>Now the musicians struck up and everybody began dancing,
even quite an old woman in a corner who had no partner, but
stepped alone through the figures. The groups did not form patterns,
but each pair toed it by themselves until they reached the
end of the measure, when all formed a circle, partners pledging
each other in their festival-cups and crying; &ldquo;Light! Light!&rdquo; Gaidu
Pyax danced well, swinging Lalette strongly when the step called
for it. Food was presently brought in, and from time to time a
servant would summon the elder Pyax, whereupon he would go
to the door and return with a new guest on his arm, clapping
hands to make everyone stop what they were doing, whereupon
all shouted &ldquo;You are welcome!&rdquo; as before, and there would be
more drinking of pledges.</p>
<p>Lalette began to feel quite giddy and happy, no longer minding
that all these people seemed to be talking about how terribly
expensive everything was, or staring at her across their shoulders,
as though she were an actress. She did not think anyone here
would betray her to the provosts; the women all seemed to be
trying to be kind. The thought of what Dame Leonalda would say
if she knew her daughter were in such a place struck Lalette as
funny, and she sat down, laughing softly to herself over it, to
find Aunt Zanzanna bending over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to lie down for a while in your room? We
have such a nice one for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>It was easier to walk with the older woman&rsquo;s arm around her.
The room was up two flights, heavily bowered with hangings,
and Lalette thought she noted a scent of musk as she lay down
on the rich bed in all her clothes. The musk made her feel sick;
when she returned from the cabinet she felt so weak she had to
lie down again, but the melody of the volalelle they were dancing
down there would not let her alone, it kept going round and round
inside her head as she slipped down through drowsing wakefulness
to full dream and an uneasy sleep. It must have been nearly
day when she woke again, and she felt stiff. The scrape of violins
still came from below; for a few minutes she considered returning
to the festival, then slipped off her clothes and got into bed.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>She woke again to see complete spotted sunlight bright across
the wall, wondering for the first sleepy seconds where she was. It
was a footstep that had roused her; she turned her head and saw
Gaidu Pyax looking down, with spots on his costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greeting of the morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all Lalette could say, pulling the covers close around
her neck, and then; &ldquo;Well, I greet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile she had once thought rather pleasant became fixed.
&ldquo;I have come to keep the spring with you.&rdquo; He laid his hand on the
edge of the covers. &ldquo;You are my partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not this time. No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is festival morning. You must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What would Rodvard say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His laugh had an edge of nastiness. &ldquo;His head will be on another
pillow now. I know him. Why should you not do it as well as he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached down and began to paw at the bedclothes against
her resistance, the scream she tried to give was only a squeak in
that heavy-hung and distant room, and then he flung himself on
her, catching her wrist to twist it around, crying; &ldquo;Witch, witch, I
will tame you or break all your bones.&rdquo; She bit at the hand that
touched her face, and with her own arm swung a sweeping blow
that took him where head and neck join. He was suddenly standing
beside the bed again, and she was saying low and furious, through
tears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you force me, I will kill myself and you, too. I swear it by
the Service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaidu Pyax&rsquo; lips pouted out like a little boy&rsquo;s, he sank slowly
to one knee beside the bed, reaching a hand out gropingly. &ldquo;Ah, I
knew it couldn&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; he said, and lifted toward her a face of
wordless misery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>For a long minute she looked at him, all her fierceness and resolution
melting in the face of that unhappy desire. (She felt no
spark for this boy, only thought: and what if I do, they do not want
me, it was all a deceit put upon me, and I can at least heal this
one&rsquo;s hurt); and was just reaching from under the covers to draw
him to her and comfort him&mdash;</p>
<p>When a flash of lightning wrote in letters of fire across the inside
of her mind the words <i>Will you go with me now?</i> and though there
was no meaning in what they said, she understood that it told the
unfaithfulness of her lover.</p>
<p>The hand that had extended to take that of Pyax patted it instead.
&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps it was my fault. I should have
told you. . . . When others do it, I never could. But I thank you
for the good festival.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">13</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FAREWELL AND GREETING</span></h2>
<p>Back again to the place of masks through streets littered with the
sour debris of festival, among which languid sweepers toiled. After
what had happened, Lalette did not ask to say farewell to the elder
Pyax or Aunt Zanzanna. There was a twitch at the corner of the
doorman&rsquo;s mouth as he let them out; she would not let Gaidu accompany
her farther than the market square (for morning had brought
back all the anxiety of the price still on her apprehension). He remarked
somewhat spitefully that he could understand how she
would not wish to have her people see a Zigraner bringing her home.</p>
<p>Laduis answered her knock; he seemed truly happy to see her.
The widow was at the cookshop; Lalette changed the mask of Sunimaa
for her worn clothes, finishing just as the woman returned. They
ate, talking but little, and that much in light terms. Dame Domijaiek
sent the boy out, and as his footsteps went down the stair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is at Sedad Vix.&rdquo; Her mouth worked a little, and with the
calm eyes fixed upon her, she could keep it back no more. &ldquo;He has
been unfaithful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the witch-families we cannot help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah. Then it is a knowledge gained through falsity and witchcraft,
not through the God of love, and so will lead to no good end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unhappy,&rdquo; was all Lalette could whisper, (not understanding
what the woman was trying to say).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is because you look on this man as personal to you. Love
must share with all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(There was something passionately wrong with this, Lalette felt,
but rue and the after-lash of last night&rsquo;s wine and this morning&rsquo;s
experience had left her too low to seek out the flaws.) She began to
weep softly.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the widow said: &ldquo;Let us reason. If you owe
him not less than all love, so he owes as much to you; and by destroying
your joy, he has failed his obligation. Do you still love him,
not as we must love all, but to yourself, as of the material world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It seemed to Lalette as though there were something big and
dark and heavy in her breast where her heart ought to be, and she
had no clear thoughts at all any more.) &ldquo;I did not&mdash;ah, I do not
know, he is all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a mother, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mother who tried to sell me! And still would, if she could
find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she wishes to save you from distresses she herself has
felt. That also is done in love, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have no love!&rdquo; cried Lalette, looking up furiously,
tear-drops sparkling on her lashes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hate and hate and hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tiny red spot appeared on each of Dame Domijaiek&rsquo;s cheeks.
&ldquo;I do not think you had better say that again in this house,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I have an arrangement to make, and will return before evening.
Tell Laduis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went out, leaving a Lalette who could hardly bear herself,
nor find anything to do, in her mind going over and over the dreadful
ground of Rodvard&rsquo;s treachery and the fact that he was one of
the Sons of the New Day. Even if he came to her now, she would
not have him, that book was closed by his own hand; and the boy
Laduis coming in, she allowed him to draw her out of her megrims,
so that when the widow returned, they were almost gay together.
But it was almost dawn before sleep touched her.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>She came awake with a start, and the sense that something dreadful
had happened. It must be late morning; the widow was gone
from the other side of the bed and Laduis&rsquo; cot was empty and neatly
made up. There was&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>All at once the whirl at the back of her mind resolved itself into
a pattern. There were two things in it, a picture of a strange room
where men talked before a fire while a sea beat on a rocky shore,
and running through it as though the picture were transparent, an
appeal so naked and desperate that it brought her to her feet at
once&mdash;mind speaking to mind without words to say that the holder
of her Blue Star was lying bewitched and near death.</p>
<p>There was no wine; it was horribly hard to trace out the pattern
of the counter-witchery in water, even with the help of some dust
from the corner, and the effort of the projection left her so weak and
shaken that when it was done she collapsed across the bed in the
shift that had served her as a night-dress and did not even hear
Dame Domijaiek come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have done it,&rdquo; said her voice (and Lalette thought that
she had never in her life heard anything so cold).</p>
<p>Lalette raised her head. The older woman was looking at the
patterns which still moved faintly, not at her at all. &ldquo;I ask your
pardon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was an emergency; I learned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you can say will change the fact that you have brought
witchery into my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette struggled to her feet. &ldquo;Well, I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mask-maker, &ldquo;I think you must go. You have
brought on me and my son even worse dangers than you dream of.
You must go. When you spoke of hating yesterday, I thought it
might come to that, but I foolishly let sympathy overrule my judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the room above them, Mme. Kaja struck a chord on her music,
and after one false beginning, launched into the bride&rsquo;s aria from
&ldquo;The Disinherited.&rdquo; Lalette looked at the floor and there were tears
in her eyes. The widow spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you were sent to me for help, and help you I will, if you
will take it. I think there is only one chance in the world for you,
and that is to go to Mancherei and place yourself under the dominion
of the Prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no money to get there, no money at all, and what
could I do there?&rdquo; said Lalette (now angry with herself for having
jeopardized herself and the widow too, in some manner, for the
sake of false Rodvard; and willing in her contrition to follow this
leading, but not seeing how it could be done).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love forever finds a way to draw to itself those who need it.
There is a fund for the transportation of those who would go
thither; and under the ordinance of the Prophet, there have been
established the houses called couvertines of the Myonessae, where
there is shelter and gainful employ for such girls as yourself, who
need them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not believe in this religion, and&mdash;I am a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>&ldquo;Few believe in the beginning, but only turn to our doctrine for
relief from some condition of the world. It is this witchcraft you
must escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette heaved a sigh. (Her head ached now, and what was the
use of this struggle to be free and one&rsquo;s own? The strings tightened,
one was drawn back to puppethood.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. If you will tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The conventicle was held at the back of a warehouse; people
sat on bales of wool, or leaned against them. Guards against the
provosts had been set at the door. One, who was addressed as
&ldquo;Initiate&rdquo; pronounced a discourse of which Lalette hardly understood
a word, it was so abstract. She could hardly keep her eyes
open; the descent into doze and the jerk back were agonizing. A
desiccated woman who breathed through her nose was seated on
the next bale. At the end of the discourse, she took Lalette&rsquo;s hands
in both her own, with a gesture astonishing until one observed that
all the people in the gathering were similarly greeting neighbors.
To Lalette&rsquo;s surprise most of them seemed to be well-to-do people
with an expression of almost dogged cheerfulness, but there seemed
about them something lacking, as though they had bought this good
cheer with the sacrifice of some quality.</p>
<p>The thin woman was still talking when a man with an engraved
smile touched Lalette&rsquo;s arm and said that the Initiate would like to
see her. The man&rsquo;s face was calm as though carved in stone; he
asked her whether she was married? Had read the First Book of the
Prophet? Drank fortified alcohols? Practiced the Art? He looked at
her as though his glance would bore straight through when she answered
the last honestly that she had done so, but would practice
it no more. Then he pronounced a discourse as incomprehensible as
that he had given to the company, ending by saying she must be
reborn into purest love.</p>
<p>At the close of this he told her that he had looked into her heart
and believed her honest, but that she must carefully study the Prophet&rsquo;s
First Book. He gave her a letter for the cargo-overseer of a
vessel even then at the wharf; the book, he said, would be furnished
to her aboard by the third mate of the vessel. Dame Domijaiek had
been her guarantee; love would be her protector. She was kissed on
the forehead and they all went out into a spring twilight with drizzles
of rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>At the wharf someone was trying to lead a protesting horse into
the ship, among stampings and confused shouts. Lalette huddled in
the shadow, as close as she could get to the widow Domijaiek and
regarded the masts running up into the grey, with their climbing
triangles of rope tracery. A wide plank led through a gap in the
bulwarks before them, but now the horse was disposed of, the
ship&rsquo;s people were engaged in some bargle at one end of the vessel;
no one paid any attention to the two women who tripped to the
deck and stood uncertain. At last a man detached himself from the
group with a cheerful farewell and came along the deck toward
them, cap on head and munching a piece of bread. He would have
passed with a brief stare in the assembling gloom, but the widow
halted him with outstretched hand and asked where was the overseer
of cargo?</p>
<p>He halted with mouth open and cheek puffed out with food. &ldquo;By
the lazarette,&rdquo; and before either could put another question, disappeared
round a wooden structure that rose from the planking. A
few spurts of rain fell. Lalette shivered more snugly into her cloak
(wondering whether &ldquo;witch&rdquo; might not be written on her forehead
to make all shun her save those whom others shunned, as Amorosians
and Zigraners). Now the chatter broke up and three or four
men together came toward the head of the plank, porters mainly
with their iron hooks in their belts. The exception had broad but
stooped shoulders, a close grey mat of beard and an unlighted lantern
in his hand. To him Dame Domijaiek addressed herself, inquiring
where the lazarette might be.</p>
<p>He waved a hand. &ldquo;Aft of the tri-mast, leftward&rdquo;; then glanced
at Lalette, stepped close and peered at her so directly that she
shrank away. &ldquo;For Ser Brog, mother?&rdquo; he said, and turned to the
older woman. &ldquo;Looky here, mother, I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen you before along
Netznegon dock, eh? You come to see me when you finish with Ser
Brog, and maybe we do business, eh? At Casaldo&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The porters
laughed and one of them bubbled a derisive sound through his lips
(Lalette was already repenting her undertaking).</p>
<p>A voice behind a door told them to enter. It belonged to a tall
man with white hair, whose black fuzzy eyebrows leaped up a long
face when he saw that his visitors were women. He did not rise, but
cast a half-regretful glance at the sheet of computations on a leaf
let down from the wall before him. The letter he at first held far
away as though it were an affiction of proclamation; when he grasped
its purport and had seen the signature, he rose, all courtesy.
&ldquo;Aye, hands must wash face,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I trust you left Ser Kimred
well? Will you be having a little wine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>Dame Domijaiek excused herself, since she must return to her
child, but as she embraced Lalette farewell, the girl felt thrust into
her hand a little cloth pouch with coins in it, and was suddenly at
the edge of weeping. When she turned, Ser Brog had set out a pair
of pewter cups and was drawing the cork from a bottle of wine. He
bowed her to the single chair, himself taking the edge of the built-in
bed, which was so hedged about by cabinets that he must bend.</p>
<p>He said; &ldquo;So you are seeking a sea-voyage, Demoiselle Issensteg?&rdquo;
(This was the name the letter had given her.) &ldquo;Are you one
of the inland Issenstegs from Veierelden? I hear there have been
troubles in that region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Was he trying to draw her into indiscretion, and how much did
he really know of her origin and purpose?) She said that she was
not of the Veierelden branch and waited. He asked her politely
whether she had had a joyous festival and were a good sailor. When
she said that she had not been at sea before, his face took on some
concern, and he regretted that the captain&rsquo;s wife, who usually
sailed with them, would not do so this voyage. There were no other
women aboard. He would provide her with a bell for summoning
someone when needed&mdash;&ldquo;not that you will be molested, demoiselle,
but I will say the third mate is as strange&mdash;as a dog with two heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, Ser Brog finished his wine and rose to light her to a
duplicate of his own tiny cabin. She decided she had been mistaken
about the question, he was only expressing interest in the friend of
a friend. It was nice not to have to be afraid. An hour or so later, as
she sat curled up on the bed, but not yet disrobed, came a demonstration
of how well the Amorosians cared for their own. A knock
on the door turned into a porter with a neatly-strapped small trunk,
painted with her assumed name. It held an assortment of body-linens,
shoes and a dress in her size, new and of good quality.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>She was roused by feet beating in rhythm and the sound of
distant shouts; a big round spot of light swung slowly from side to
side across the door. Last night had shown her a jug and a basin
beneath the let-down leaf that formed a writing table, but the water
was so cold it gave her goose-pimples. The new dress would need
taking in at the shoulders, so after trying it, she returned to the old
before stepping toward the deck along a passage that held three
more doors like her own. Two men in yokes were pushing and relaxing
on opposite sides of a pivoted bar (to steer the ship, she supposed),
under the orders of an officer in a green cap. One of the
workers was the curl-bearded man who had accosted Dame Domijaiek
the evening before. He relaxed one hand to touch his forelock
and had the grace to look sheepish. The officer hardly looked at
her; he was watching the masts that rose on every side and the
small boats about, for they were well out into the Bredafloss, moving
steadily downstream, though the sails hung so flat, it seemed
they could contain no air at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>Lalette stepped past the steersmen to watch the slow pageant
of river moving by, and heard a step. Ser Brog; he touched his cap
and invited her to breakfast, down a flight of steep stairs and along
another passage to an apartment at the rear of the ship. A skylight
threw dappled gleams across a table laid for five, with food already
on it. Another man was standing by; Ser Brog presented the second
mate, and as he did so, a big officer with a firm chin and bags
under his eyes came in with an air of great hurry and sat down
without waiting for the rest. This was the captain, Ser M&uuml;lvedo;
he bounced half an inch from his seat when his name was mentioned,
and fell to eating while the rest were taking their places.</p>
<p>Lalette thought his courtesy somewhat strange to one who wore
a badge of good condition, and it was stranger still when a youngish
officer entered, to be greeted by the Captain with; &ldquo;You are
tardy. You know the rule of the ship. Take your meal with the
crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer went out sourly, but not before Lalette recognized
him as the one who had directed her toward the lazarette.
The meal went on in silence; when the Captain rose, so did the
others, and Ser Brog touched Lalette&rsquo;s arm to take her to the deck
again. The spring air was fine, the stream-bank all tricked out in
tender green. Lalette looked (and felt with a thrill of delight that
all was really now spring for her, she was free from the old life and
everything to win), but Ser Brog was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to dream,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dreams do be what we grow by. I would be saying that
you had brought luck and fair weather on our leave-taking&mdash;for all
but Tegval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one sent from his breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He.&rdquo; The cargo-overseer laughed. &ldquo;Our third mate is an admirable
young man, with only one flaw&mdash;that he has discovered how
admirable he is and does not stint his own admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The third mate would give her the book.) Said Lalette, watching
a tall unpainted barn without a window that walked slowly
past along the shore; &ldquo;Yet your captain seemed very harsh with him
for so light a fault.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">321</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is only the rule of the sea. On a ship one learns early
that in this world there is no such thing as following one&rsquo;s own desire;
it is all a pyramid of orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are grim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I only see things as they are.&rdquo; Now he began to make remarks
which she must have answered, for he smiled and continued
(but now her mind had leaped far away, and she was wondering
whether she would see Rodvard again ever, or recover her Blue
Star? Bound out to sea and away; it was his fault, who had given
her unfaithfulness and desertion in exchange for the offered kindness
and the abandonment of her mother. And now she wondered
why she had embarked on the counter-witchery without even questioning
whether she should; she felt a tear behind her eye, and
hoped he had come to know what resources of fidelity and good
will he had lost in her. No, not again, I&rsquo;ll never let another have the
making of my joy.)</p>
<p>A whistle was blown; men moved along the deck of the ship,
and Tegval came toward them with his cap insouciantly on one
side to be presented. He had the same look of inner peace as the
Amorosians of the conventicle, but mingled with it an air of dash
and recklessness.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">14</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE EASTERN SEA; THE CAPTAIN&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p>A frond of white had spread across the sky as they talked. Lalette
went to her room in the round covered-house that rose from
the deck, and applied herself to the needle. Making the new dress
right was a problem, since she had done little but broidery before,
and she became so taken with fitting and clipping as not to note the
tick of time; then felt drowsy, and lay down to be roused by a knock
at the door.</p>
<p>It was Tegval, third mate. &ldquo;May I lead you to supper?&rdquo; The ship
had no motion when they reached air; here they were in the middle
of a brown-blue tide, with flat shores stretching to green-blue on
either flank. Tegval helped her graciously down the stair, and was
this time prompt enough so that all of them were waiting when Captain
M&uuml;lvedo came in. This officer was now at ease, cracking his
face into a smile for Lalette and trying to converse with her about
people a demoiselle of condition might be expected to know. Some
of them she did know, but was forced to avoid the issue lest he learn
the falsity of her name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>Tegval offered her his arm after the meal, and showed her
around the deck as far forward as the tri-mast, his discourse being
of the parts of the ship and the beauty of the sea. He would answer
little when she asked him about Brog, the Captain and other personalities,
and as evening was now beginning to grow shadowy,
with a hint of chill, she announced an early return to her cabin. He
leaned close as he handed her in the door and said in a low voice
that he would knock at the fourth glass of night with a book, then
tipped a finger to his lips to prevent questions (and she realized
that even on a ship trading to Mancherei, it was not too well to be
an Amorosian).</p>
<p>With no desire for sleep, she stretched out on the bed and tried
to solve her riddles&mdash;how it was that her mind should turn to the
seldom-felt nearness of Rodvard. There had been about him the
faintest trace of some odor like that of old leather, masculine and
comforting. She was a little irritated at herself for feeling the lack of
it, and her mind drifted off through other angers till she lay there
in the dark, simmering with wordless fury over many things; the
ship began to move. The change in circumstance made her conscient
of what she was doing; she began to weep for her own
troubles, the tears trickling into the hard pillow where her face
was buried, thinking that after all Rodvard had perhaps been right
to slip away from a witch with so vile a temper.</p>
<p>There was a lamp hanging from a kind of pivoted chandelier.
She swung out of the bed to light it, but had to strike more than
once to obtain a good spark. By this time there was the queerest
feeling in her stomach as though it were turning; she lay down
again, not sure whether this was the over-robust supper she had
eaten or the veritable malady of the sea. Orderly stampings and the
sound of shouts drifted through the cabin&rsquo;s small window as her
illness declared itself more firmly; she was miserable, her mind
going round like a rat in a slat trap until a whistle was blown
four times and someone knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Tegval, of course, with an overjacket on that swung as he stood
balancing to the motion of the ship on widespread feet. &ldquo;We sail
on a fair and rising wind,&rdquo; said he, in a lilt. &ldquo;Good fortune. Are you
troubled by the sea, demoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;ill.&rdquo; (Hating to confess it.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter. Give me your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>It was taken in both his in a manner curiously impersonal, the
eyes were closed and his lips moved. They opened pale blue. &ldquo;You
will be well,&rdquo; said he and sat down on the chair which, for the first
time, she noted as bolted to the floor. She did not believe him and
the swing of the lamp made her dizzy (and now she could feel his
personality reaching out toward her with an effort almost physical,
and was enough ashamed of her former angers to put into her tone
some of the kindness now felt toward the race of man):</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most good. I was told you would have a book for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He undid his lacings and produced from beneath the jacket a
volume, large, flat and all bound in blue leather with the royal coat
of arms of Dossola on it to indicate who was the author. &ldquo;You
should not let it be seen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our cargo-overseer takes the
law&rsquo;s letter so seriously that he would denounce his best friend&mdash;which
I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may count on me.&rdquo; Their fingers touched as he handed it to
her, no longer impersonal, and she let the contact linger for a brief
second, before leafing over the pages. They were printed in heavy-letter
with red initials. &ldquo;What a beautiful book!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the word of love,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A true word, a good word&mdash;&rdquo;
chopping off suddenly as though there were more it would be imprudent
to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will read it.&rdquo; She did not want him to go quite yet and sought
for words. &ldquo;God knows, I need some help in the tangle of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;We make a distinction between the god of evil and
the God of love, in whose arms we may lie secure from the savagery
that infests the world. Ah, inhumanity! Today a plover lit in the
rigging, and what must they do but net that bird to be eaten by
the captain. I could barely consume my supper for thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette stirred. &ldquo;I do not understand this feature of your doctrine.
One must often go hungry by thinking so, it seems to me. Do
we not all live by the death of other beings, and even a plant suffer
when it is devoured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tegval stood up. &ldquo;In true love, as you will learn, all are parts of
one body, and must give whatever another needs for sustenance.
Read the book and sleep well, demoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone, and to Lalette&rsquo;s surprise, so was her illness.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was a strange book, cast in the form of a marvellous tale about
a young man whose troubles were manifold, and only because he
sought at each step to control his actions by reason, as he had been
taught; it seemed that reason forever deceived him, because something
would arise that was not comprehended in his philosophy,
but was born from the natural constitution of an imperfect world.
Thus reason always led him into doing evil, from which he would
only be rescued by rejecting reason for affection to his fellow-men.
Lest the reader should miss any part of the thought, he who had
set this down abandoned his romance from time to time to draw a
moral, as: &ldquo;None can turn from vileness to virtue but those unbound
by the teaching of the academies that consistency is a virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
<p>Lalette found such interjections an annoyance, but forgave many
of them for the beauty of the words, which were like a music; and
the great glory of the descriptions of clouds, trees, brilliant night,
and all the things that one person may share with all others, but
were polluted (said the author) when the one would hold them to
himself. Yet the type of the volume made it hard reading, the swing
of the lamp made it flicker, so after a time she turned out the light
and drifted to sleep.</p>
<p>By morning the ship was leaning through long surges under a
grey sky with all her sails booming. It was hard to keep food on
the table; at breakfast Captain M&uuml;lvedo rallied Lalette hilariously,
saying she was so good a sailor he must send her to the masthead to
run ropes. Brog smiled at her paternally; the first mate, whose ears
moved at the end of a long jaw as he chewed, laughed aloud at the
Captain&rsquo;s light jest, and offered to teach her to direct the steering-yoke.
On the deck she felt like a princess (that this adventure would
succeed after all, glad that she had done with tortured Rodvard),
with her hair blowing round her face and salt spray sweet on her
lips. The waters set forth an entrancing portrait of sameness and
change; she turned from the rail to see Tegval all jaunty, with his
eye fixed bow-ward, balancing lightly.</p>
<p>Said Lalette; &ldquo;I would be glad to know what witchcraft it was
you used to cure me so quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No witchcraft, demoiselle,&rdquo; said he, not turning his head, &ldquo;but
the specific power of love, which wipes out misery in joy. And now
no more of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ship heaved; she would have lost her balance but that he
put out a hand to sustain her, and the Captain&rsquo;s voice bellowed:
&ldquo;Tegval! I will thank you to remember that an officer&rsquo;s duty is to
watch his ship and not the pretty ladies. You will do better in the
forward head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<p>He had come unobserved upon them; now as the third mate
made a croak of assent, he touched his cap to the girl. &ldquo;No disrespect
to you, demoiselle. You know the legend old seamen have,
ha, ha, of sea-witches with green hair that speak to the spirit of a
ship and witch her to a doom that is yet ecstasy for her crew? Be
careful how you handle the people of my ship; for at sea I have
the rights of justice and can diet you on bread and water.&rdquo; He
shook a finger and ruffled like a cock, laughing till all the loose
muscles of his face pulled in loops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my hair is not green,&rdquo; said she, falling into the spirit of his
words for very joy of the morning (but thinking with the back of
her mind&mdash;what if he knew I am a witch? and&mdash;this one can do
nothing for me; why am I here?).</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a mate with me once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the old <i>Qu&igrave;nada</i>
at the time of the Tritulaccan war, which you are too young to remember,
demoiselle.&rdquo; He ducked his head in a kind of bow to emphasize
the compliment. &ldquo;Yeh, what a time of it we had in those
days, always dodging from one port to another, and afraid we&rsquo;d be
caught by a rebel cruiser or one of those Tritulaccans and finish our
years pulling an oar under the lash in the galleys of an inshore
squadron. A dangerous time and a heavy time; you cannot imagine
the laziness of some of these sailors, demoiselle, who will see their
own lives sacrificed rather than keep a sharp watch. I do remember
now how we were making into the Green Islands in broad daylight,
when I found one of them sound asleep, cradled in the capon-beam
forward, where he had been set as a lookout&mdash;and in the
Green Islands, mind you, where armed vessels would lie in among
the branches to pounce on you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you shall not think it was an exciting life, demoiselle, for
the thing no one will ever believe is that in war you go and go, attending
death with breakfast and nothing ever happening, so that
it is almost a relief to fight for life. This mate now&mdash;what was his
name? He was always called Rusty for no reason I could ever
plumb, since his head was not rusty at all, but dark as yours&mdash;well,
Rusty, the mate, you could hardly call him handsome, but he was
gay and lively and had a good tongue. Always telling stories he
was, of things that happened, and the good half of them happened
to other people, though he took the name of it. But bless you, nobody
minded, he could carry off the tale so well. I call to mind how
one night when we were both together at the home of Ser Lipon,
that was our factor, Rusty started right in with the story of a polar-bear
hunt in the ice beyond Kjermanash that I had no more than
finished telling him about the day before, just as though he had
been in the center of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat with my mouth open, but never saying a word, because it
had not happened to me, neither, and beside, the Lipons had a
daughter, a pretty little thing named Belella, who seemed as much
doting on Rusty as he on her, and it was no part of my game to
spoil him, since I was spoken for already, y&rsquo; see? So he told the
story of the polar-bear hunt and soon enough the two of them were
off in an angle of the parlor, and within a week they were married.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">326</div>
<p>Brog approached, touching his cap. &ldquo;Your pardon, Captain,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;There is a trouble among those bales of wool. I can find but
six marked for your account, whereas by the papers it should be
thrice that number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&uuml;lvedo frowned. &ldquo;Ah, pest, I am engaged.&rdquo; He took Lalette&rsquo;s
arm tight under his own. &ldquo;See me later, Brog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved a few steps away, the captain steadying her
against the shuddering heave of the sea. &ldquo;That was his name now,
Piansky, though why he should have been called Rusty I never
could see. They were married, as I said, after one of those lightning
courtships we sailors have to make because we have no time
for any others, and they went to live in a big house in Candovaria
Square, which the old man had built, and some said it was a cruel
waste of money for just the two of them. But I could never follow
that, since she was the only daughter, so she would have come
into the whole inheritance in time, and she was only getting what
would be hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One voyage Rusty missed while they were building their nest,
but after that he came back to us, happy as a rabbit, and well he
might be with a fine wife, a good home and his fortune made. It
was about that time my own wife died; Rusty took me home to be
with him while the ship lay over for a new cargo. Dame Belella
always had a great deal of wine and a house full of people, different
ones always, to whom Rusty must forever be telling some
tale of his adventures. She would laugh at the ridiculous parts and
look proud over him. They were very gay; at least up to the time
of the Tritulaccan war, which I was speaking of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember going to Rusty&rsquo;s house after the second or third
voyage in that war, and a dangerous running passage it was, too,
out with wool to the south and back with goods for the army, but
our captain had judged where the Tritulaccans would be, and we
never saw a sail of them. That was the passage where we slipped
through the Green Islands, as I have said. We reached Rusty&rsquo;s
house late in the evening; the parlor was already full with people
sitting drinking round the fire, and Dame Belella stumbled as she
got up to embrace him, which shows how much cargo she had
taken aboard already, ha, ha. She let him take her place while she
sat down on his lap, saying we must be quiet because here was
Ensign Glaverth of the Red Shar, who had been on a raid right
through the Ragged Mountains, and was just telling about it. I
did not think a thing at the time, since this Glaverth was sitting on
the floor with his back to a red leather hassock, and besides he
was one of those Glaverths from Ainsedel, the family they call the
mountain Glaverths, to distinguish them from the ducal branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was telling how he had requisitioned a bed in a Tritulaccan
farmhouse where there was a daughter, and made love to her,
so that she told him of an ambush that had been set for the Shar.
As I said, I had no hint that Rusty would take it ill till he suddenly
interrupted the tale by throwing his cup into the fire and
crying that he would have no more of this southern red, which he
called hog&rsquo;s water and traitors&rsquo; wine, but wanted the honest fiery
beverage of the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three of them laughed and Dame Belella put her
finger over his lips, and after that she had called the servitor for
fired-wine, she begged this Glaverth to go on with his tale. When
he had done and they were all murmuring to ask him questions,
Rusty pushed his wife off his lap as though she had been a sack
of meal and stood up next to the fireplace, with his own cup in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You sows of soldiers,&rsquo; he said (begging your grace, demoiselle,
but he said it so); &lsquo;You sows of soldiers talk of your perils, but
they are not real dangers at all, only what you could meet with on
a city street and solve with a strong arm or a little straight talk,
or&rsquo;&mdash;well, I will not say what else he said, demoiselle, but it was
something that made all those in the room to gasp, if you know
what I mean, and at least a third of them wearing coronet badges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yah!&rsquo; Rusty said, &lsquo;Your Tritulaccan wenches! What could
they do at the worst but slip a steel splinter in your back, so that
you go to Heaven with the Church&rsquo;s blessing for the glory of old
Dossola? But the harridans we seamen must deal with could cost
a man his soul and eternal agony. Even now I may be a lost man&mdash;a
lost man.&rsquo; I remember how he said it, putting both hands to his
face with a sob, and somebody dropped a cup. They all thought
Rusty taken with wine, d&rsquo;you see, and so did I, but now he began
to tell a long tale, with no sign of winishness at all in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_328">328</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was all of our voyage to the south through the Green Islands
and I swear to you, demoiselle, had I heard it before I
sailed, I would not have sailed at all, so gruesome he made it,
with escapes from storm and Tritulaccan raiders and all this only
a prelude to telling of a thing he said happened in the Green Islands,
where we lay becalmed one night, and he walked the deck.
He said then he heard a sound like far-away singing, and the ship
began to move without a wind. Going forward, he said, he saw
something like pools of green fire in the water; therefore knew
the ship was approached of sea-witches who were carrying her
on. Would have let go the brow-anchor, he would, but all the men
of the deck watch were staring over the side, so little obeying him
that they even shook off the hands he laid on them. The song went
to his own heart and he knew that the ship and all in it must soon
be doomed; therefore, he, Rusty, who still had some part of his
wits, conceived the measure of going forward to say they could
have him as a willing victim if they would release the rest. This
was accepted, he said. One of the demon women clambered to the
ship through the rope-hangings and companioned with him all
night, then bade him farewell with the word that he must come
to her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle, I do tell you that never have I heard Rusty give
a tale better. But when it was finished, the Ensign Glaverth took
Dame Belella&rsquo;s hand to bid her good night, saying that he would
bring his young cousin over to hear some more of Rusty&rsquo;s tales,
and all the others began to go as well. When all were departed,
Dame Belella came to sit on the hassock where the Ensign had
been, staring into the fire for a while. &lsquo;Will you never become a
man?&rsquo; she asked her husband when he would have touched her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at her a little. &lsquo;Have I said the wrong thing?&rsquo; he
asked, and was that not a strange question to put?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The wrong thing, yes,&rsquo; she said, looking away into the fire,
without as much as turning her head. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t like it any more,
even if it were not true, Rusty.&rsquo; I remember that, because I did
not understand and still do not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not say anything more at that time, but I noticed that
people were not coming to the house so often as before during this
stay of ours in port, and while we were on the next voyage, she sold
the place and went out in the west to live. So I think perhaps, it
was a good fortune to lose my own wife, though a great sorrow at
the time, because people do change and grow apart instead of
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave-crest came across the bulwarks and wetted the edge
of Lalette&rsquo;s dress a little, so that she moved against the supporting
arm. Said she (wondering why he had told her this tale); &ldquo;But she
must have known that he only made it up about the sea-witches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be, could be, now. Could be that she was angry
with him for saying so much to a coronetted man like that Ensign
Glaverth. But I think more like that just all of us want a new bed-partner
now and again, and she could not bear it that he thought
of it before her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">15</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CHARALKIS; THE DOOR CLOSES</span></h2>
<p>Brog leaned back and lifted up his cup. &ldquo;As human people age,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the most important part of the body does gradually move
northward from organ to organ, beginning with the feet, on which
you will notice a baby&rsquo;s attention always fixed, and ending with old
men who do nothing but sit still and let thoughts go through their
heads. Now I have myself reached the comfortable age of the
stomach, for which I give thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaw,&rdquo; said the first mate through a mouthful of food. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d
put Ser Tegval lower down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wee lower, yes.&rdquo; Brog looked at Lalette. &ldquo;But do not trouble
you; in my capacity, I am charged with the duty of bringing all
cargo to port as safe as it left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile twisted his face into the cartography of a river-furrowed
mountain chain, and he swivelled round to look hard
at Blenau Tegval. The first mate gulped once and said; &ldquo;Saving
always captain&rsquo;s orders, ser cargo-overseer. Captain has rights on
a ship at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette stood up, her body swaying with the slow drift of the
slung lamp overhead, and asked permission to leave, having
learned that it should be asked. The laugh began before she
reached the deck, Brog&rsquo;s dry snicker beating time to the first mate&rsquo;s
guffaw. She had so little lost her resentment at their remarks and
the suggestion that she was spied upon that when Tegval tapped
on her door in the break of twilight as usual, she cried through the
wood for him to begone. But the horror of lonely hours took her
before she had more than issued the words; she leaped up, opening
the door and calling that she must consult him, he was to come
in. This was a mistake, too; there immediately arose the question
of what she was to consult on; and after a blank word or two,
she could do no better than ask what the Prophet&rsquo;s book meant
by denying reason?&mdash;when it seemed to her that only a reasonable
person would read it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; said the third mate, sitting down and taking her hand
in his (which she did not mind). &ldquo;It is the failure of human reason
and human love that drives us to the higher love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>(Though she thought this might be true in her own case, and
could even look forward with a little exaltation to the new life in
Mancherei, she was unwilling to break the talk by admitting it,
so) she said; &ldquo;But Blenau, how can this higher love make up to
us for sorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this he somewhat unexpectedly demanded to know whether
she believed in another life than that visible, and it was at her
lips to say that a witch could hardly do otherwise when he saved
her by hurrying on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, this other life itself must be Love for us, since we
are its children; and since this is so, it will replace all we have
lost, and more beautifully, as one does for a child. If you have
lost a lover&mdash;as I think you must, or you would not be for the
Myonessae&mdash;it is only that you may find a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(To Lalette it seemed that this was hardly more than half true,
and ice-cold counsel for a smarting heart); she started to say
something, but just then the door was tapped, and here was Brog,
with a smile that showed all his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, little demoiselle, I thought to entertain you from being
alone, but see there was no need for my trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned against the wall, babbling at a great rate and not
without salt, seeming to take delight in Tegval&rsquo;s frown, which
also filled Lalette with so much amusement that she felt herself
sparkling at Brog&rsquo;s conceits on such matters as&mdash;can a fish swim
backwards? The young man grew grimmer, and at last rising,
said he must rest if he were to be a good officer in the night
watches. Brog did not stay long after.</p>
<p>It was still early in the night; she lay back among the covers
to consult with the book again, but after her good cheer in the
company, found the volume mere gloominess and dull as could
be. Wondering what her manner of life in Mancherei would be
like if all were ordered by such a volume, and feeling the despair
of a bird bruising its wings against a cage of circumstance, she
found happiness forever elusive. This escape and that slid across
her mind, but all was either dream or half-dream; and as the rising
wind began to rock the ship, she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Waking was blended with wonder that one creak among the
many from the straining vessel should have roused her; then she
became fully sentient, catching the reason. That single sound had
come from her own door. Her lamp had gone out. &ldquo;What do you
wish?&rdquo; she called on a rising note, and in the black heard three
waves slap the ship before there was an indrawn breath and an
answer not higher than a whisper; &ldquo;Dearest Lalette, I have come
to be your lover.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>Tegval. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was close. &ldquo;But you must; to refuse the gift of love is to
lose all. You are of the Myonessae.&rdquo; (Oh, God of gods, again, she
thought; do men want nothing but my body? The temptation
flashed and passed to give him this and live within the confines of
her mind.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I say. I will cry out.&rdquo; She writhed away from his touch,
but he found her in the narrow space, the arm pinned her close
and his head came down on her breast as he said, thickly; &ldquo;But
you must, you must. I am a diaconal and I have chosen you. I
will tell them in Mancherei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grip was so strong that it paralyzed, but he did not for
the moment attempt to go further. Scream? Would she be heard
above the rocking wind? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no. Ser Brog will hear.
The Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the watch to daybreak. No one aboard will ever know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I will not,&rdquo; replied Lalette, (feeling all her strength
melting), though he did not try to hold her hands or to put any
compulsion upon her but that of the half-sobbing warm close contact,
(somehow sweet, so that she could hardly bear it, and anything,
anything, was better than this silent struggle). No water;
she let a little moisture dribble out of her averted lips into the
palm of one hand, and with the forefinger of the other traced the
pattern above one ear in his hair, she did not know whether well
or badly. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said fierce and low (noting, as though it
were something in which she had no part how the green fire
seemed to run through his hair and to be absorbed into his head).
&ldquo;Go, and return no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breathing relaxed, the pressure ceased. She heard his feet
shamble toward the door and the tiny creak again before realizing;
then leaped like a bird to the heaving deck, night-robed as
she was. Too late: even from the door of the cabin, she could
see the faint lantern-gleam on Tegval&rsquo;s back as he took the last
stumbling steps to the rail and over into a white curl of foam.</p>
<p>A whistle blew; someone cried: &ldquo;A man lost!&rdquo; and Lalette was
instantly and horribly seasick.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you plainly, demoiselle,&rdquo; said Captain M&uuml;lvedo,
&ldquo;that if it were not for Ser Brog saying how he saw with his own
eyes that this young man moved to the rail without your urging,
I should have been most skeptic. As things stand, I must acquit
you of acts direct. As for others, as employment of the Art, they
are a matter for a court of Deacons, and since you are bound to
Mancherei, you&rsquo;ll be beyond such jurisdiction.&rdquo; He stared at her
gloomily. &ldquo;As captain of this ship, and therefore judge in instruction,
I must ask you to keep your cabin until we reach port.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>Lalette looked at the moving gullet of the first mate as he
stood by the Captain beside the bed, and even this sight seemed to
make her the more ill. Said Brog&rsquo;s voice, dry as a ratchet; &ldquo;Aye.
You have my word for it. The little demoiselle never touched a
hand to him as he went over. But he came from her cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more rehearsing of things known. We know all except
what she will not tell us,&rdquo; said M&uuml;lvedo. (Her body ached all over
from lying in the one position.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; It was Brog again. &ldquo;Yesterday he was all quick with
life, maybe a little hasty, but a kindly, helpful young man, and
now the fishes are tearing pieces of his guts out.&rdquo; Brog&rsquo;s face
wrinkled in what might have been a smile, had there been any
mirth in it.</p>
<p>She turned her face away and began to retch, but nothing
came up beyond a few drops of spittle, bitter and sour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nice to think on, no,&rdquo; said Brog. &ldquo;But nicer than the
mind that would bring such a death to the lad; there&rsquo;s the real,
black, stinking hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The bird of Lalette&rsquo;s mind felt the bars shift in tighter, she
wanted to cry and beat with her hands.) Said Captain M&uuml;lvedo;
&ldquo;Ser Brog, I have acquit this demoiselle of direct acts. You will
oblige me by not questioning as though the matter were still to
decide. If this were the Art, no jurisdiction lies in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my captain, and I am therefore even under your
orders, even as to this court of the ship,&rdquo; said Brog, his thin lips
closing sharply. &ldquo;But I am master of the cargo, of which she forms
a part, and it is my province to know what kind of goods I deliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Lalette had a sense without seeing it directly that the chandelier
swung twice as she looked at the three and thought&mdash;the
truth? But how to explain about the trip, what Tegval had done,
how he had demanded the deepest fruit of love as a casual thing
like a cup of water, dragging her down?) &ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; she said in
her dying voice, and swallowed again, turning eyes of misery toward
the Captain.</p>
<p>He frowned (and she knew it for a frown in her favor, and
knew the reason for it and hated him and herself). &ldquo;Ser Brog,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I now declare the court shut. This demoiselle is not cargo
but a person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">333</div>
<p>Brog&rsquo;s wrinkles ran deeper; the three passed out, the Captain
remaining till latest, to pat her hand on the coverlet. Revolt ran
through her veins at kindness for the wrong reason, which was
worse than hate or anger; there was no understanding in this
seaman who only wanted to change bed-partners now and again,
she was afloat on a sea of desires.</p>
<p>The daylight swung from powder to deep dusk. One knocked,
and it was the gnome-like creature who stewarded for the Captain,
who offered her a bowl of broth. The motion of the ship
being a trifle easier, she was able to eat a little and hold it, in
spite of the shadow that lay across her mind. (But I will not regret,
she cried inwardly, and then one-half her mind played critic to the
other and cried&mdash;no, no. Is there no surcease?) The hours slid by
along a silent stream, and she was alone.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>All movement ceased. Sickness dropped from her like a veil,
and from beneath burst such a joy of spirit as Lalette had rarely
known, so that she could have sung herself a song, as she almost
leaped from her place to put on the new dress. There was no
mirror and she had to feel the strands of her hair into the demoiselle&rsquo;s
knot, hoping the result would not look too recklessly wild.
Outside the deckhouse, shouts and confused, orderly trampings
were toward, but no one came to call for her until long after she
had packed everything into the small trunk, with the book Tegval
had given her at the bottom. The door was tapped; Brog, followed
by a man with a red peaked hat and a fur of sidewhisker,
who held an annotation-roll in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Demoiselle Issensteg,&rdquo; said Brog (and Lalette
reflected incontinently that it was hard to distinguish an appearance
of melancholy in a face from one of dissipation). &ldquo;I transmit
her to you. She is recommended from Ser Kimred, the residentialist
at Netznegon.&rdquo; He handed the man in the hat a folded
letter. &ldquo;It is my duty to warn you that in this ship she has been
confined on suspicion of man-murder through witchery. In the
home country, I would have brought her before a Court of
Deacons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dunnier bowed, as unsmiling as Brog himself, then with
his annotation-roll as a wand, touched Lalette on the arm and
her little trunk. &ldquo;This is not Dossola, but Mancherei,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Subject to the regulations of the realm of Mancherei, and the
association of the Myonessae, we accept her charge and her possessions.&rdquo;
Then, turning to Lalette; &ldquo;In the name of the God of
Love, come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_334">334</div>
<p>(Knowing barely the name of these Myonessae, unwilling to
ask more lest she somehow tip over the razor-narrow bridge of
safety) Lalette only smiled and turned to the door. A plank-way
led to the dock; the sun shone yellowly upon a row of wharfside
houses, whose brick looked as though streaked with wet, while at
many windows there was bunting as though for a festival, but
much of it faded, miscolored or torn. As she watched, she brushed
against a hand which had been held out to her and was beginning
to fall in disappointment. Captain M&uuml;lvedo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, and took the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, demoiselle. I do not believe it. If you are not accepted
here, I&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed at the edge of tears, a droll thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I will remember your kindness.&rdquo; Brog was in the
rear, looking right past her (and she had the dreadful feeling that
when she was gone, he would have no trouble in bringing the
Captain to his own point of view on her. This was goodbye to all
yesterdays.). She mounted the plank for the shore.</p>
<p>There was a great press of people about, the men in loose pantaloons
hanging over their shoes, and all walking about and yammering
as fast as they could. They seemed reasonlessly excited, as
though this were a day of crisis; Lalette could hardly make out a
sign of that calm assurance that seemed to be the mark of the
Amorosians in her own country. They stared at Lalette, the more
when two of the guards who waited at the plank with short bills
in their hands and the small &ldquo;city&rdquo; arbalests strapped to their
backs, placed themselves on either side of her at a word from the
dunnier, leading across to a building with a low door, over which
was a shield painted thickly with something that might be a pair
of clasped hands on a field of blue.</p>
<p>There was a door down the hallway rightward, with a little
man at a desk behind it, writing laboriously, his tongue in his
cheek, as the light struck over his shoulder. The guards led Lalette
in; he jumped up and threw down his quill so rapidly that a blot
was left on the paper. She noticed food-stains on his jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not interrupt, really you must not interrupt me
unannounced,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are not authorized. I am a protostylarion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His big pop-eyes with blue white seemed to swell as they fell
on Lalette; one of the guards laid a paper before him saying; &ldquo;A
candidate for the Myonessae, on the incoming ship from Dossola.
Orders of the dunnier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah.&rdquo; The protostylarion was no taller than she herself as
he came fussing importantly around the desk to move a chair two
fingerlengths for her convenience, then diddled back to his place.
The paper made him frown. &ldquo;Ah, ah, suspicion of the Art. This
does not happen often these days, but you are very fortunate to
be here, demoiselle, instead of in Dossola. Ah&mdash;you have read the
First Book of our great leader and Prophet? Answer me now, the
misfortune of the loss of patrimony, why do you think that came
upon him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Not quite sure whether he meant the character in the book,
or the Prophet&rsquo;s own ejection from the heirship of Dossola), Lalette
said hesitantly; &ldquo;Why, sir, I&mdash;I suppose it would be because
he tried so arrogantly to increase it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirable, admirable. Whereas if he had given of it freely
to the old aunt, it had been returned to him in high measure.
From which we learn, demoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The jargon was distasteful, but) &ldquo;That we must lovingly give
all we have,&rdquo; said Lalette, remembering.</p>
<p>The protostylarion bounced up and down behind his desk as
he went on, prompting her replies in his eagerness, so that it
hardly mattered how little she had read of the famous First Book.
A porter came blundering into the midst of the colloquy with her
trunk on a hook over his shoulder. This placed a period to the
examination, for now the protostylarion fussed with his hands,
said &ldquo;Ah, ah,&rdquo; two or three times more, then to the guards; &ldquo;You
are released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the pair filed out, he drew from his desk a large ledger and
a sheet of blue-colored paper, pointed his quill and said; &ldquo;You&mdash;swear&mdash;that&mdash;whatever&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;Art&mdash;you&mdash;have&mdash;practiced&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;past&mdash;you&mdash;will&mdash;abandon&mdash;with&mdash;all&mdash;worldly&mdash;vanities&mdash;on&mdash;reception&mdash;into&mdash;the&mdash;high&mdash;order&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;Myonessae,&rdquo;
all in one breath. Then, more judicially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette&mdash;&rdquo; (should she say &ldquo;Issensteg?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you made an evasion! The God of love demands all truth
from those who come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt a cheek-spot heat at this nagging. &ldquo;Asterhax. I have
given you nothing but truth. If you doubt it I will return to the
ship that brought me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, oh no, my dear demoiselle, you must not mistake. All
pasts are buried in the world of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">336</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they will welcome you, I am sure, my dear demoiselle.
Oh, the perfect peace.&rdquo; His pen went scratch, scratch, skipping
from ledger to paper, the head cocked on one side as he surveyed
the result from one angle, then another, as an artist might
look at a drawing, and his smile approved. A fly buzzed in the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So. Demoiselle Lalette, you are now registered of the honorable
estate of the Myonessae in the service of the God of love.&rdquo;
He trotted around the desk to hand her the paper, with a red
seal on it. &ldquo;Rest here, rest here, I will seek a porter to lead you
to the couvertine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(What would he say if he knew I am a murderess? she
thought, and followed this with a quickly-suppressed flash of
anger at Tegval for having made her one.) The protostylarion came
back with a porter who grinned at her fine new dress and picked up
the trunk. &ldquo;Farewell, farewell,&rdquo; said the little man, waving from
where he sat. &ldquo;You will hardly need a carriage, it is not far.&rdquo; He
was writing again as Lalette followed the porter through the door.</p>
<p>A little recovered from her chagrins, she turned eyes about
the street to see what this strange law of the Prophet had made of
the country that was to be her new home. The streets seemed
wider than those in most of the cities of the ancient motherland,
but the new life would have little to do with that, nor with the
height of the buildings, which mostly gave red brick for Netznegon&rsquo;s
gloomy dark stone. The shop-windows were full of goods;
Lalette could hardly pause to inspect, but from the distance, they
had an air of meretriciousness and false luxury. All the people
seemed to be in a great hurry; Lalette began to wonder what they
would do if she put a small witchery on one of these urgent passengers
to make him stand like a post&mdash;then shuddered away from
the thought.</p>
<p>The porter turned a corner and they were at the gate of what
had evidently been at one time a very handsome villa, set back
deeply from the street, with a low wall in front of it. One of the
trees in the foreyard was dead and another so yellow among the
spring-green leaves that it must soon go as well. There was no
gate-tender; the porter pushed his way in and led up to the tall
oaken double door, which showed scars where an earlier knocker
had been taken off and replaced by one in the form of a sun with
spreading rays. He knocked; after a long minute an old woman
opened on a darkish hall with a pronounced odor of javelle, and
asked what was wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am registered of the Myonessae,&rdquo; said Lalette, extending
her paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must give it to the mattern,&rdquo; said the beldame. &ldquo;Set the
box there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two obulas,&rdquo; said the porter, and as Lalette produced her
purse, shot a swift, suspicious glance at the old woman. &ldquo;No. Not
in Dossolan money. Do you want me to be thrown into a dungeon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette flushed. &ldquo;It is all I have; I only arrived from there
today. Can someone change it for me?&rdquo; She appealed to the woman
who had admitted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. It is contrary to the regulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter rather surprisingly lost his temper. &ldquo;Why, you cheap
whore, you cheat, you pig-sucker!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I should have
known better than to carry for one of you Myonessae.&rdquo; He
stamped his foot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take your dirty box and throw it in the
street, if I didn&rsquo;t know the smell would kill half the people in
town when it burst open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A door opened on a sound of feminine background voices.
There appeared a woman in black, with hair piled severely close
to her head. &ldquo;What is this, Mircella?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle is new. She came without two obulas to pay her
porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark woman reached to the purse at her belt, drew forth
coins and placed them in the porter&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Here. You are never
to appear at this couvertine again.&rdquo; She turned to Lalette. &ldquo;You
may come in and show me your paper. It is evident that you are in
need of instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they passed into the side room, light fell on the woman&rsquo;s
face, and Lalette saw that, although it was both strong and stern,
it bore the same expression of distant peace she had seen in the
widow Domijaiek.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">16</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE EASTERN SEA: SYSTOLE</span></h2>
<p>The queasiness had gone from Rodvard&rsquo;s stomach and the illness
from his head, but all his senses were more alive than jets of
flame. Every rut gave him agony in the jolting mule-cart, he could
not draw away from pain long enough for anger or fear. Yet
shortly the very keenness of his hurt anaesthetized all down to no
more than an aching tooth; and now the senses, oversharpened
by witchery, began to report the world around him. They were
passing two people afoot, then another cart, to none of which the
driver made salutation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>They must be out of the village, for right overhead, branches
began to go past against a sky where horses&rsquo; tails slid across tender
blue. A bird lit on one of the branches and tipped its head to
look down. It seemed to Rodvard as he gazed into the single
revealed eye that he could, with his Blue Star, read the avian
thought&mdash;of food and sex, confused, and not unlike a human&rsquo;s.
This might only be another effect of the witchery, but it set him
thinking about his own confusion of mind and what the butler
Tuol&eacute;n had said about Star-bearers and their women; so he considered
what species of joy or completeness was to be had from
these skirted creatures, who for a spiritless complaisance would
exact a slave&rsquo;s devotion.</p>
<p>Lalette. He wondered whether her witchcraft would give her
knowledge of his infidelity of thought with the Countess Aiella,
and of deed with the maid Damaris; and if so, what penalty would
be demanded of him. Ah, no; why should penalty be due? This
was not marriage, he had taken no oath nor meant any. Give back
the Blue Star, let us pronounce a bill of farewell, and be damned
to Mathurin and his menaces, or even to Remigorius and the
cause for which all was done.</p>
<p>The mule&rsquo;s feet klopped on a bridge, the clouds were thickening
toward grey above and birds chirping as they will when a storm
is toward. No, no, friend Rodvard, he answered himself; be honorable
as you hope to receive honor. Acquiescence she gave you,
aye, beneath the trees; but you half forced her then. The night in
the widow Domijaiek&rsquo;s bed was no unwilling gift, but for both of
them the end of life and its beginning. A new life with Lalette
the witch, holding the sweetness of peril, not that of repose, something
beyond any connection that might have been formed with
Maritzl of Stojenrosek. Had she laid some witchery upon him to
make it so, not being herself affected? Seek her out, anywhere;
discover if that enchantment were forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<p>Could such things be? Witchery was something which, like
death, he had no more than heard of from the world beyond his
world. When he was a lad in the village among the spurs of the
Shining Mountains, there was the fat old woman who had grown
so dreadfully thin, all in a week, and people saying it was witchery
on her. The priest came with his oils, but it was too late, and she
died the next day, and no one ever found the witch, if there were
one. Oh, aye, there were prosecutions of witchery in town, and
now the mule-driver&rsquo;s wife, Lalette, the Blue Star, and he himself
caught into something he did not understand and which made him
afraid . . . and because he had done no more than cherish high
ideals and obey orders.</p>
<p>The pains were less, but all his muscles so immobile that they
afforded no yielding to the throw of the cart, and thus piled bruise
on bruise. A long ride; it must be after the meridian of the sun,
though even heightened perception would not tell him if this were
so, since he had lost all sense of direction in the intricacy of the
turnings. The mule&rsquo;s feet and cart&rsquo;s tires struck paving stones, the
movement became uneven, voices were audible and they were
entering a town, so that Rodvard began to hope of a rescue&mdash;and
with that hope, a fear of what would happen if there were no
rescue. What did the man mean to do with him? He found no
visible answer, for though it was evident that though the repulsive
spouses were minded for murders, and himself not the first to fall
into their clutches, it hardly seemed they would have fixed the
mechanician&rsquo;s badge on his breast in mere anticipation of disposing
of a body.</p>
<p>Droll to think of oneself as a body&mdash;an idea he did not remember
having held before, ever. His mind achieved a wedding between
this line of thought and the earlier one, or how it was when
that urge toward the Countess Aiella had slipped out of merely
playing a part into deep desire, it was the voice of body speaking
to body. But it was not that way on the widow&rsquo;s bed; that night
it was as though a flame sprang up, to which their bodies responded
last of all. Ah, Maritzl (he thought), with you also there might
have been such a union of flames, to last forever and ever, only
I did not know, I did not dare, before the Blue Star had bound
me to this other.</p>
<p>Now a certain brightening of the diffused light reflected into
the cart told him they were passing houses with snow-white walls;
by this, with the time and distance, they must be in Sedad Vix
city. Odors floated to him&mdash;salt water, fish, the spicy products of
the south, not unpleasantly blended. The docks. Was the man
going to make him a body by heaving him into the sea? To his
futile angers was added that of not being able to see the
old rascal&rsquo;s eye&mdash;now the Blue Star had recovered its virtue
under the witch-wife&rsquo;s ministration&mdash;but there was time for little
more of thinking, for the cart drew up with a cry to the mule, the
driver got down heavily, his feet sounding on stones and then on
plank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
<p>He was gone briefly; Rodvard felt the covering taken from
him, and with a grunt, he was hoisted to a shoulder, stiff as a log.
A whirling view of pallid dockside houses, the masts of a tall ship
with her sails hanging in disorderly loops; he came down with a
jar that shook every bone onto what appeared to be some structure
projecting from the deck, where a red face surrounded by
whisker looked into his own. One eye in the face was only a
globule of spoiled milk; (the cold Blue Star on Rodvard&rsquo;s heart
told him the good eye held both cruelty and greed).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah,&rdquo; said Redface. &ldquo;The fish is cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you now, live as an eel. Fetch a mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Redface reached out a dirty-nailed hand and pinched Rodvard&rsquo;s
cheek, hard. &ldquo;Mmmmb. A spada&rsquo;s worth of life. To save
argument, I&rsquo;ll give you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ey, look at him, a proved mechanician with a badge and all.
I say to you, my old woman she has done with him so he&rsquo;ll work
like a clock, pick, pick, never mind time nor nothing. A gold
scuderius; you should give me two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They chaffered horribly over his body, while Rodvard lay
moveless as a statue (thinking of how he was one, alas not cradled
in light and speed like the Wing&egrave;d Man to whom he had
compared Count Cleudi when Cleudi marked the resemblance
between them; not upborne by spirit like the figure of the archer-hero;
but a stiff corpse, subject of a sale, a carcass, a beef). He
heard the chink of money passing; the one-eyed man gave an order
that Rodvard was to be taken below, and someone carried him
awkwardly with many bumpings down a ladder to a tight room
smelling of dirty humans. He was tossed high onto a kind of shelf
and left alone for a long time (thinking all the while of what
the mule-driver had said about his being witched to work like a
clock, and wondering whether it were true).</p>
<p>After a while, a doze came upon him, for which there was no
emergence till the round hole in the ship&rsquo;s wall had ceased to give
light. The place filled suddenly then with feet and words, many
of the latter with a Kjermanash accent, or in that language itself.
One of these persons pointed to him and there was a laugh. Rodvard
tried to turn his head, and to his surprise found it would
move a tiny arc, though by an effort that redoubled the agony
throughout the bruised mass of his body. Yet the stirring was a
joy as great as any he had ever experienced, and he lay repeating
it, as the assemblage below&mdash;garrulous as all Kjermanash&mdash;came
and went with pannikins from which floated an appetizing perfume
of stew. Rodvard found other movements beside his head, and lay
repeating them through the twinge of pain. A whistle blew, some of
the men went out and up, while the others undressed noisily, put
out the light and composed themselves for sleep on shelves like
that which bore the young man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>For him there was little sleep, and as life flowed along ankylosed
muscles, he was invaded by a sense of irrevocable disgrace,
so poignant that it drowned fear. Damaris the maid . . . he had
sold his soul for a copper there . . . not that he felt to the girl
any profound debt as to Lalette, or that such a debt were just&mdash;but
whether from the priests&rsquo; teaching at the academy, or the
words of Remigorius, he had somehow grown into a pattern of
life which, being violated, one was cast down into a sea of life
by merest impulse . . . ah, no, should it not be rather that each
event must be judged by itself? . . . and no, again&mdash;for by what
standard shall one judge? Impulse or an absolute, there is no third
choice.</p>
<p>So thinking, so seeking to find a clue to conduct (or to justify
his own, merely, Rodvard told himself in a moment of bitterness),
he lay on his comfortless couch, aware that the ship had begun to
move with uneasy tremors; and presently dawn began to flower.
At the room&rsquo;s entrance a lantern showed a bearded face, into
which a whistle was thrust to blow piercingly. All the men leaped
from their shelves with a gabble like a common growl and began
dressing in the greatest haste. The bearded man shoved through
them and shook Rodvard so rudely that he was jerked from his
shelf, coming down thump on the deck, with feet that would not
hold him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rouse out!&rdquo; said the bearded man, catching him a clout across
the headbone. &ldquo;You lazy scum of shore mechanicians must learn
to leap when the mate sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard staggered amid coarse laughter, but having no means
of protest, followed the Kjermanash, who were scrambling rapidly
up the ladder. They were in open sea; the breeze was light, the
day clear and the air fine, but even so, the slight motion gave him
a frightful qualm. His first steps were across the deck to the rail,
where he retched up all that lay on his stomach, which was very
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; said the bearded mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodvard&mdash;Berg-elin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call you Puke-face. Go forward to the mainmast, Puke-face,
eat your breakfast if you can, and then repair the iron fitting that
holds the drop-gear repetend. The carpenter&rsquo;s cabinet under the
break of the prowhouse will give you tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot use tools. I am&mdash;a clerk, not a mechanician.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>&ldquo;Death and dragons! Come aft with me, you cunilingous bastard!&rdquo;
The mate&rsquo;s hand missed Rodvard&rsquo;s neck, but caught a
clutch of jacket at the shoulder, and dragged him along the deck
to where a flight of steps went up, and the one-eyed captain stood,
an ocular under his arm. &ldquo;Captain Betzensteg! This lump of excrement
says it knows nothing of mechanic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sick though he was, Rodvard felt the Blue Star burn cold and
looked up into an eye (brimming with something more than mere
fury, something strange from which his mind turned). &ldquo;Diddled,
by the Service!&rdquo; said the voice, between heavy lips. &ldquo;When next&mdash;ah,
throw your can of piss up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard was jerked against the steps, striking his shin, and
stumbled up by using his hands. The one-eyed captain reached out
and ripped the badge from his breast, tearing the cloth. &ldquo;Go below,
stink-pot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and tell my boy he&rsquo;s promoted to seaman.
You shall serve my table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Rodvard and looked around for his route, since
all the architecture of a ship was stranger to him than that of a
cathedral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said the captain, and lifted an arm as though to strike
him with the ocular, but changed his mind. &ldquo;What held you from
telling your status?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Rodvard, and gripped the rail of the stair-head,
for his gorge began rising within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you puke on my deck you shall lick it up.&rdquo; The captain
turned his back and shouted; &ldquo;Lift the topper peak-ropes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the stairs again there were not so many ways to choose
from, so he took to the door to the right (hoping under his mind
that this would be an omen) along a passage and into a room,
where a sullen-faced lad of maybe eighteen was folding a cloth
from a table. &ldquo;You are Captain Betzensteg&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo; asked Rodvard,
trying to keep from looking through the window, where the sea-edge
rocked slowly up and down. &ldquo;I am to say you are promoted
seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad&rsquo;s mouth popped open as though driven by a spring,
he dropped the napery and ran around the table to seize Rodvard
by both arms. &ldquo;Truly? If you trick me&mdash;&rdquo; For one instant pale eyes
flashed fury and the small down before first shaving trembled.
But he must have seen honesty before him (&ldquo;Born for the sea and
freedom!&rdquo; his thought read), and quickly thrust past to make for
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Rodvard, holding him by the jacket. &ldquo;Will you not
show me&mdash;?&rdquo; The spasm caught him and he retched, mouth full
of sour spittle.</p>
<p>The lad turned laughing, but without malice, and clapped him
on the back. &ldquo;Heave hearty!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will come better when
you come to learn the free way of the ocean; grow to love it and
care nothing for landlouts. Here are the linens.&rdquo; He opened the
midmost of a set of drawers built into the wall. &ldquo;The old man
takes no napkins save when there are guests aboard&mdash;a real dog
of the brine, with fish-blood in his veins, that one! I am called
Krotz; what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard&rsquo;s telling, he hardly seemed to notice, but continued
his flood of instructions. &ldquo;In these racks are the silvers; he uses
only the best, and be careful at dinner to set his silver bear on
the table, it was given him by the syndics at the time of the
Tritulaccan war for his seamanlike skill. The bed-bunk you must
carefully fold in at the base, but he likes the top loose, so. Wine
always with the early meals, it is here. If the weather&rsquo;s fair he
sometimes takes fired-wine in the evening. If he orders it so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad Krotz halted, looked sidewise out of his eyes and
leaned close. &ldquo;Hark, Bergelin, I am not what you would call
jealous. Have you ever&mdash;that is, when he has fired-wine, he may
desire to treat you as his lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Rodvard recoiled, and retched again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, do not be so dainty. It is something that every true seaman
must learn, and keeps us from being like the landlouts. You
do not know how it can be, and he gives you silver spadas after.
But if you will not, listen, all the better, when the old man calls
for his fired-wine, set the bottle on the table, take away the silver
bear, and call me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard (no little astonished, that the emotion of which
The Blue Star spoke was indeed jealousy); &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll have none of
it, ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile of delight so pure that Rodvard wondered how he had
thought the lad&rsquo;s look sullen. &ldquo;The cook will give you breakfast.
I must go&mdash;to be a seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
<p>Captain Betzensteg ate by himself. Rodvard was glad that he
remembered the silver bear, but when he tried to hold forward
the platter of meat as he remembered seeing Mathurin do it for
Cleudi, he got things wrong, of course, and the one-eyed man
growled; &ldquo;Not there, you fool. The other side.&rdquo; The meat itself
was something with much grease, pork probably, which it sickened
Rodvard even to look at as the captain chewed liquidly,
pointing with his fork to a corner of the cabin and declaring he
would barber someone of his ears unless it were kept cleaner.
That night there was no call for fired-wine; Rodvard felt a surge
of gratitude for preservation as he cleared up after the meal, and
made his way forward to the crew quarters in what he now had
learned to be the peak-jowl.</p>
<p>Sickness sent him to his shelf at once, for the movement of the
ship was becoming more vivid as twilight fell, but sleep had not
yet reached him when there was a change of duty, as in the morning,
and of those who came tumbling down the ladder, Krotz was
one. He was much less the lord of the earth than earlier; no
sooner was the lad in place than all the Kjermanash were after
him unmercifully, with hoots and ribald remarks, pinching his
cheeks and his behind, till at the last the lad, crying; &ldquo;Let me
alone!&rdquo; flung his arms out so wildly that he caught one of the
sailors a clip on the nose and sent him staggering. The fellow
snarled like a tiger, all his rough humor dissolved in black bile,
and recovering, whipped out a tongue of steel. But Rodvard, without
knowing how or why he did so, rolled from his shelf onto the
shoulder and arm that held the knife, bearing the man to the
floor.</p>
<p>The Kjermanash fought upward; Rodvard took two or three
nasty blows on the side of the head, as he clung with both his
hands to the dagger, and knew with more interest than fear that he
must lose in the end to the overbearing strength of the man. But
just as he was giving way, a pair of hands beneath the armpits
wrenched him clear and flung him against the shelves, while a
big foot kicked the knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; demanded the voice of the bearded mate.
&ldquo;Puke-face, you&rsquo;ll have a dozen lashes for this, damme if you
don&rsquo;t! You to attack a full-grade seaman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard, feeling of his head; &ldquo;He would have knifed
Ser Krotz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ser!&rdquo; The mate barked derision, and his head darted round
like a snake&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Is this veritable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Kjermanash began cawing together; the mate appeared
to comprehend their babble, for after a minute or two of it, he held
up his hand with; &ldquo;Shut up. I see it. This is the sentence&mdash;Vetehikko,
three days&rsquo; pay stopped for knifing. As for you, Puke-face,
your punishment&rsquo;s remitted, but in the future, you&rsquo;ll sleep in the
lazarette to teach you your true status aboard this basket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<p>He turned to the ladder, and not a word from the Kjermanash
for once, but as they glowered among themselves, young Krotz
came to throw his arms around Rodvard. &ldquo;I owe you a life,&rdquo; he
said, at the edge of tears.</p>
<p>Said Rodvard; &ldquo;But I will pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no. I&mdash;will surely buy you free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know there was status aboard a sea-ship; you said
the life on one was free as a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it is, indeed, but not for lack of status, which is the
natural order of things. Are you an Amorosian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It nearly slipped off Rodvard&rsquo;s lips that he was rather of the
Sons of the New Day, but Krotz&rsquo; words showed how little he
would find such a confession acceptable, and he did not trust the
Kjermanash; and by another morning, the ship&rsquo;s motion told on
him somewhat less heavily.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">17</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CHARALKIS: THE DEPTH AND RISE</span></h2>
<p>It would be maybe on the fourth day out (for time had little
meaning on that wide blue field) when Rodvard remarked how at
the evening meal Captain Betzensteg took more than usual wine,
glowering sullenly at his plate while he jabbed a piece of bread
into gravies as though they had done him a harm. The last mouthful
vanished, he sucked fingers undaintily and without looking
up, said; &ldquo;Set out the fired-wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard felt a cold sweat of peril. The silver bear leaped from
his fingers, and it was his fortune that he caught it before it
reached the floor. The captain sat with eyes down, not appearing
to notice. Bottle clacked on table; the one-eyed man poured himself
a deep draught, and at the sound of the door opening, said;
&ldquo;Stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard turned. Both the captain&rsquo;s hands were on the table,
gripping the winecup and he was staring into it as though it were
a miniature of his beloved. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">346</div>
<p>(Fear: but what could one do or say?) Rodvard glided to his
post in serving-position behind the chair. For a long breathless
moment no sound but the steady pace of someone on the deck
above, muted slap of waves and clatter of ship&rsquo;s gear. Then the
head came up, Rodvard saw how the rich lips were working (and
in that single eye read not only the horrible lust he had expected,
but that which gave him something akin to pity, a ghastly agony
of spirit, a question that read; &ldquo;Shall I never be free?&rdquo;) Captain
Betzensteg lifted the cup in his two hands and tossed off the contents
at a gulp, gagged, gave a growl of &ldquo;Arrgh!&rdquo; and, reaching
up his left hand, ran it pattingly over Rodvard&rsquo;s buttocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man under his breath, pulling away. The
captain jerked to his feet, violently oversetting his chair, and with
distorted face, drove his fist against the table. &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Do you not know your benefit?&rdquo; and reaching to his purse, tossed
clanking against the bottle a handful of coins. Rodvard shrunk
away, and giving a kind of mewing cry as the one-eyed creature
leaped, tried for the door. His foot caught something, he took
three desperate lunges, gripped the handle as the huge fist caught
the side of his head and spilled him through onto the deck, senseless.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>When next he knew, there was a sour smell of wine, it was dark
and dripping sounded. He could not think through the curtain of
headache; the scampering was undoubtedly rat, but why? Where
was added to why with slowly gathering memory&mdash;still on the ship
certainly, since the bare boards on which he lay heaved with a
slow and even beat.</p>
<p>The right side of his neck was sore, and the opposite soreness
was on his head. He thought: ah, for why am I so punished? and
heaved himself upon an elbow to find a pannikin of water by his
side, which he drank greedily. It was dark, a kind of velvet twilight;
yet not so dark that he failed to make out that he lay prisoned
in a narrow passage between tall casks that rose on either
hand, groaning in their lashings. The quantity of light must mean
day was outside, and he had lain a long time. Now he came afoot
and wondered whether he should seek the deck, but decided contrary,
since someone for some reason had brought him here, and
there might be perils abroad. Sleep? Ah, no. He sat down to think
out his situation, but could make no sense of any part, therefore
abandoned the effort, and with a tinge of regret over his lost books,
let his mind run along the line of Iren Dostal&rsquo;s sweet rhymes until
tears reached his eyes.</p>
<p>This could not occupy him forever, either; a profound and
trembling ennui came on him, so his fingers made small motions
tracing out an imaginary design. A long time; a step sounded,
coming down from somewhere and then along among the casks.
Krotz. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be careful. Oh, do not make a noise. He would hurt
me if he knew I helped you. Here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">347</div>
<p>In the gloom something was thrust against Rodvard&rsquo;s hand
which, by the touch, he knew for a dish of congealing food. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I was struck and lost remembrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You truly do not know? I thought it was feigned when you
failed to speak as he said you were to be thrown overside, and he
took the young Kjermanash&mdash;.&rdquo; A shout sounded flatly from above.
&ldquo;Oh, I could hurt him. I must go.&rdquo; The last words went dim as
Krotz disappeared among the tall columns of casks and Rodvard
was left to his meditations. The food was a stew of lamb, and it
tasted like candle-grease.</p>
<p>Dark had come before the lad did again, with a meal even
worse than its foregoer; trembling and unwilling to talk. Rodvard
found himself fingering round the great casks from one curve to
another, counting the planks in them and thinking whether there
might not be some mathematical relation in the figures he counted.
A futile thing to do, he told himself, wishing he had Dr. Remigorius&rsquo;
philosophy, who often spoke of how a man should be complete
in himself, since each one lives in a self-built cell of pellucid
glass and may touch another only with, not through, that veil. Ah,
bah! It is not true (he thought); I have been touched sharply
enough by this very Remigorius, but for whom I&rsquo;d not be in such
a coil, with Lalette and Damaris, ideals thrown down, and on a
mad voyage to nowhere. . . . There was something wrong with
this, on which he could not put the finger&mdash;so now he fell to counting
the planks again, or try to make a poem, ending the effort with
an inward twitter, as though mice were running under his skin, as
he waited, not with patience, for the next arrival of Krotz with his
purloined food.</p>
<p>The lad was faithful, but always looking over his shoulder;
trembling so that it was nearly impossible to get two consecutive
words from him, by which it came about that there was no plan
for Rodvard&rsquo;s escape when the word was that Charalkis Head had
come in sight. The ship would lie that night in the harbor of Mancherei&rsquo;s
brick-built capital, and what counsel now? Shifting his
feet like a dancer, Krotz said he thought Rodvard might easily
slip past the deck-guard into the water; but this scheme split on
the fact that he lacked the skill of swimming. All was still undecided
that night; a sharp sword of apprehension pricked his fitful sleep,
nor were matters amended when he was fully roused by hammerings
over the doors of his prison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_348">348</div>
<p>Kjermanash voices sounded their customary cackle. A shaft of
light struck down, so brilliant that Rodvard&rsquo;s dark-hooded eyes
could scarcely bear it, and he shrank back along the cask-alley,
hands over face. It was not the best means of hiding; down swung
one of the Kjermanash to fix the tackle for lifting out the cargo,
gave a whoop and pounced, being presently joined by other sailors.
There was much laughter and excited talk in their own language;
they patted Rodvard and tweaked the long-grown hair on
his face, then urged him up the ladder deckward, with &ldquo;Key-yip!
Kee-yup!&rdquo; and a sheath-knife that banged him in the crotch
from behind as he climbed, blinking.</p>
<p>At the top he stumbled out on a deck where the mate stood,
wrinkling eyes against the sun. &ldquo;Puke-face, by the Service! I
thought you had been fish-farts long ago. Oh&eacute;, captain! Here&rsquo;s
your cheating mechanician!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Rodvard noticed that Captain Betzensteg was a few paces
beyond, talking to a man in a decent grey jacket and a red-peaked
hat, but wearing no badge of status. The one-eyed monster turned,
and his full lips twisted. &ldquo;Put him in the lazarette with chains,
since he&rsquo;s so slippery. Well have the trial at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The single eye looked on Rodvard (and it said one thing only&mdash;&ldquo;Death.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The young man staggered; he cried desperately: &ldquo;I appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A captain&rsquo;s judge on his own ship. I reject your appeal. Take
him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the man in grey; &ldquo;A moment, Ser Captain. This is not good
law for the dominion of Mancherei, in whose authority you now
stand. We have one judge that stands above every mortal protestation,
that is, the God of love, whose law was set forward by
our Prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain snarled, black and sour; &ldquo;This is my ship. I order
you to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the grey jacket had a thin, ascetic face. One eyebrow
jagged upward; &ldquo;This is our port. I order you to leave it
without discharging a single item of your cargo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare not. Our Queen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has no rule in Mancherei. That was tried out at the time of
the Tritulaccan war. Young ser, what is the ground of your appeal
to our law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The Blue Star was cold as cold on Rodvard&rsquo;s heart, but there
seemed a bright shimmer like a haze in the eyes that met his, and
not a thought could he make out through it.) He said; &ldquo;Because
the captain of this ship would be both jury and accuser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lies,&rdquo; growled Betzensteg. &ldquo;My underofficer is the accuser,
for that this man refused to repair a drop-gear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">349</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a question of fact, to be decided by a court which can
gain nothing from the decision,&rdquo; said the man in grey, calmly. He
swung to Rodvard. &ldquo;Young man, do you place yourself in the
justice of Mancherei, to accept the rule and decision of its authority?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Rodvard (willing to do anything to escape the
terror of that baneful optic).</p>
<p>The man in grey produced a small paper scroll and touched
Rodvard lightly on the arm. &ldquo;Then I do declare you under the
law of the Prophet of Mancherei; and you, Ser Captain, will interfere
at your gravest peril. Young man, take your place in my boat.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Rodvard was motioned to the bow of the craft, from which
floated a banner with a device much resembling a dove, but it was
in the false heraldry of grey on white, and hard to make out.
Spray was salt on his face; as they reached a stone dock a ladder
was lowered down, and he would have waited for the grey man,
but the latter motioned him imperiously to go up first.</p>
<p>The pierside street hummed with an activity that to Rodvard
seemed far more purposeful than that of languid Netznegon, with
horses and drays, porters bearing packages, men on horseback
or in little two-wheeled caleches, pausing to talk to each other
under the striped shadows thrown across the wharfs by a forest of
tall masts. Their clothes were different. From a tavern came a
sound of song, though it was early in the morning. (It seemed
to Rodvard that most of the people were more cheerful than those
of his homeland; and he thought it might be that the Prophet&rsquo;s
rule had something to do with it.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said one of the barge-rowers, and touched him on
the arm. He was guided across the dock and up to a pillared door
where persons hurried in and out. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked the
grey man, pausing on the step; made an annotation, then said to
the rower guide; &ldquo;Take him to the Hawkhead Tavern and see that
he has breakfast. Here is your warrant. I will send archers for the
complaining mate, but I do not think the court will hear the case
before the tenth glass of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a prisoner?&rdquo; asked Rodvard.</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s face showed no break. &ldquo;No; but you will find it
hard to run far. Be warned; if you are not condemned unheard,
no more are you released because the accuser overrode his right.
The doctrine of our Prophet gives every grace, but not until every
debt is paid and the learner finds by what it was he has been deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_350">350</div>
<p>He made a perfunctory salutation and turned on his heel.
Rodvard went with the rower, a burly man in a shirt with no jacket
over it, asking as he strode along; &ldquo;What was it he meant by saying
I&rsquo;d find it hard to run far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face composed in wrinkles of astonishment. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s an
Initiate! You&rsquo;d no more than think on an evasion when the guards
would be at your heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard looked at him in counter-surprise (and a shiver ran
through him at the thought that these people of the Prophet might
somehow have learned to read minds without the intervention of
any Blue Star, a thing he had heard before only as a rumor).
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said to change the subject. &ldquo;I see no badges of status
anywhere. Is it true that you have none in Mancherei?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man made a face. &ldquo;No status in the dominion&mdash;at least that
is what the learners and diaconals say in their services.&rdquo; He looked
across his shoulder. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll give you status enough, though, if
you hold to their diet of greens and fish. Bah. Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breakfast was not fish, but an excellent casserole of
chicken, served by a red-faced maid, who slapped the rower when
he reached for her knee. He laughed like a waterfall and ordered
black ale. Rodvard hardly heard him, eating away with appetite
in a little world of himself alone (hope mingling with danger at
the back of his mind), so that it was a surprise when the rower
nudged him and stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reckoning&rsquo;s made for you, Bogolan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come the
meridian, you&rsquo;ve only to ask for bread and cheese and beer. Go
out, wander, see our city; but do not fail to return by the tenth
glass; and take notice, your Dossolan coin will buy nothing in
shops here, it is a crime to take such monies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swaggered out. The last words recalled Rodvard to his
penniless condition, and he looked along himself uncomfortably,
seeing for the first time how the black servant&rsquo;s costume he had
from Mathurin was all streaked, dirty and odorous, with a tear at
the breast where the badge had been wrenched off. There was no
desire to present himself to the world in such an appearance. He
shrank back behind the table into the angle made by panelling
and the tall settee to think and wait out his time, watching the
room around him. On the floor of the place, the press of breakfasters
was relaxing; maids were deliberate over clattering dishes,
calling to one another in strong, harsh voices. He could not catch
the eye of any to use his Blue Star in reading her thought, which
might have been a pastime; and his own affairs were in such suspense
and turmoil that thinking seemed little use. After a while
the shame of merely crouching there overcame that of his garb,
so he got up and went outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_351">351</div>
<p>The town was in full tide, and noisy. There was no clear vista
in any direction, the streets lacking Netznegon city&rsquo;s long boulevards,
angling and winding instead. The buildings were set well
apart from each other. Rodvard feared being lost among the intricacies
of these avenues, therefore formed the design of keeping
buildings on his right hand and so going around a square, crossing
no streets, which must ultimately bring him safely to his
starting-place.</p>
<p>The district was one of houses of commerce, mingled with tall,
blank-faced tenements. A droll fact: there were no children in
sight. In the shop-windows were many articles of clothing, so
beautifully made they might have been worn by lords and princesses.
He did not see many other goods, save in one window that
displayed a quantity of clerks&rsquo; materials, rolls of parchment, quills
and books, nearly all finely arabesqued or gilded&mdash;which set him
to wondering about what manner of clerks worked with such tools.</p>
<p>The inn swung round its circle to present him its door again.
It was not yet the meridian, therefore he crossed the street and
made another circuit, this time reaching a street where there were
many warehouses with carts unloading. Round the turn from this
was a house of religion, with the two pillars surmounted by an
arch, as in Dossola, but the arch was altered by being marked with
the device of a pair of clasped hands, carved in wood. A man came
out; like the one who had rescued Rodvard from the ship, he was
dressed in grey. The look of his face and cant of his head were
so like the other&rsquo;s that Rodvard almost spoke to him before discovering
he was heavier built. The grey clothing must be a kind
of uniform or costume.</p>
<p>A wall bordered the grounds of this building, with a cobbled
alley, which had a trickle down its middle. Rodvard followed it,
pausing to look at wind-torn placards which lay one over the other,
proclaiming now a festival for a byegone date, the departure of
a ship for Tritulacca, a notice against the perusal of the latest book
by Prince Pavinius, or a fair for the sale of goods made by certain
persons called the Myonessae, a new word to Rodvard. The alley
at length carried him to face the inn again. He wished for a book
to beguile the time, but that being a vain desire, went in to seek
his former place. Not until he sat down did he see that the nook
opposite him was occupied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">352</div>
<p>It was a little man, hunched in a long cloak, so old that his
nose hooked over his chin, making him look like a bird. Before
him was a mug of pale beer; he was deep in thought and did not
look up as Rodvard sat down, but after a moment or two sipped,
smacked his lips and said; &ldquo;Work, work, work, that&rsquo;s all they
think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard (glad of any company); &ldquo;It does not do to work
too heavily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gaffer still did not elevate his eyes. &ldquo;I can remember, I
can, how it used to be in the Grand Governor&rsquo;s time, before he
called himself Prophet, when on holy days we did not labor. And
we going out on the streets to watch processions pass from Service
with the colors and silks, but now they only sneak off to the
churches as though they were ashamed of it, then work, work,
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drank more of his beer. Rodvard was somewhat touched by
his speech, for though he was hardly one to defend Amorosians
to each other, it was just these processions in silks while so many
were without bread that bore hard on Dossola. He said; &ldquo;Ser, it
would seem to me that no man would worry for working, if he
could have his reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man lifted his eyes from his mug (Rodvard catching
behind them a feeling of indifference to any reward but calm)
and said; &ldquo;Silence for juniors, speech for seniors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the maids approached; Rodvard asked for his bread
and cheese and beer, and drew from her a smile so generous that
he looked sharp (and saw that she would welcome an advance,
but the thought at the back of her mind was money). The ancient
shivered down into his cloak again, not speaking till she was gone.</p>
<p>Then he said; &ldquo;Reward, eh? What use is your reward and finding
money to spend when it buys nothing but gaudy clothes and
a skinfull of liquor, no credit or position at all? Answer me that.
I tell you I would not be unhappy if we went back to the old
Queen&rsquo;s rule, and that&rsquo;s the truth, even if they send me to instruction
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ser, may I pose you a question?&rdquo; asked Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Questions show proper respect and willingness to be taught.
Ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The food came. Rodvard nibbled at his cheese and asked; &ldquo;Ser,
Is it not better and freer to live here where there is no status?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">353</div>
<p>&ldquo;No status, no,&rdquo; said the old man, gloomily. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the
pain, right there. In the old days a man was reasonable secure
where he stood, he could look up to those above and share their
glory, and we had real musicians and dancing troupes as many as
a hundred, who made it an art, so that the souls of those who
watched them were advanced. Where are they now? All gone off
to Dossola; and now all anyone here can do is work, work, work,
grub, grub, grub. It is the same in everything. I can recall how
joyous I was when I was a young man in the days of the Grand
Governor before the last, and received my first commission, which
was to carve a portrait bust for Count Belodon, who was secretary
financial. A bust of his mistress it was, and I made it no higher
than this, out of walrus ivory from Kjermanash, as fine a thing as
I ever did. But now all they want is dadoes for doorways. No art
in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it would seem to me,&rdquo; said Rodvard, &ldquo;that you have some
security of life here, so that no man need go hungry if he will
labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No spirit in it. Will go on, men working like ants till one day
they are gone and another ant falls into their place. No spirit in
it; nothing done for the joy of creation, so they must have laws to
make men work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went silent, staring into his beer, nor could Rodvard draw
more words from him. Presently a young lad with long, fair hair
came peering down the line of booths until he reached this one,
when he said that the old man, whom he addressed as grandfather,
must follow him at once to the shop, where he was wanted
for carving the face of a clock.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">18</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DECIDE FOR LIFE</span></h2>
<p>It was like no court Rodvard had ever seen. Behind a simple
table sat two of the men in grey, their features calm and strangely
like each other. At the end, one with an inkpot and sheets of
paper before him wrote down Rodvard&rsquo;s name as it was given.
The guards at either side carried no weapons but short truncheons
and daggers at the belt. The burly mate was already in one
chair, looking truculent, with a pair of Kjermanash sailors beside
him, one of them a fat-faced lad, unhealthy of appearance. A man
of negligent air, richly dressed, occupied the end of the table
opposite from the writer. There were no other spectators and the
proceeding began without ceremony when one of the Initiates
asked simply what was charged against Ser Bergelin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_354">354</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mutiny,&rdquo; said the mate. &ldquo;I gave the rat a task to do, which
he flatly refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The well-dressed man said; &ldquo;It is Dossolan law that cases of
mutiny at sea be tried by the captain of the ship, who bears
judicial powers for this purpose; else mutiny would spread through
a ship. I would have your writer here record that I make formal
demand for the body of this criminal, in accordance with the treaty
of amity and respect between your nation and the Queen, my
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the grey men said calmly; &ldquo;Be it recorded. Record also
that the treaty declares none shall be delivered before the adjudgment
of guilt, for though we be all criminous, it is not love&rsquo;s desire
that men shall exploit each other for anything but sins determined
as such by the word of human law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The well-dressed man&rsquo;s eyes said utter disgust.) His lips said;
&ldquo;How can there be an adjudgment before trial? It is to try him
that we demand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second Initiate spoke. &ldquo;This young man has placed himself
in the protection of the domain of Mancherei. Before he is delivered
for trial there is required proof of a wrong-doing that would merit
sentence. Is there such proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, damme, yes!&rdquo; said the mate. &ldquo;I saw the fellow do it; I
heard him refuse my order. Here are two of my crew to say as
much.&rdquo; He swept a hand toward the Kjermanash, who began to
cackle at once, but the first Initiate merely nodded to the writer,
who laid the pen down and clicked at the pair in their own tongue.
When they had answered, he said; &ldquo;They declare it is true that
Ser&mdash;&rdquo; he consulted his sheet &ldquo;&mdash;Bergelin was ordered to repair a
mast, and he refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Initiate looked at Rodvard (and not a thing could he read
behind those cold eyes, though they seemed to pierce him through),
saying, &ldquo;The evidence is sufficient for a trial unless you can contradict
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard; &ldquo;I could not make the repair. I did not know
how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Initiate; &ldquo;That is a question for the trial to determine; no
reason for not hearing the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate guffawed. Cried Rodvard, in despair; &ldquo;But sers, this
captain&mdash;I pray you . . . it is not for this . . . he is . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">355</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall clearly speak your trouble; for it is the will of love
that nothing is to be hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard felt the rosy flush light up his cheek. &ldquo;Well, then, it
is not for any failure of duty that this captain pursues me, but
because I would not be the partner of his unnatural lust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an exclamation, the ambassador of Dossola brought his
hand down on the table, and the hard-faced mate gave a growl,
but the Initiates were as unmoved as mountains. One of them
said; &ldquo;No lust is more natural or less so than another, since all are
contrary to the law of love, and the soul in which love runs full
tide may and should give to this unreal world of matter all that
it desires, without imputation of sin. Yet we do find that if the
wrong cause for this trial has been stated, there is a basis of appeal
to our law. We would hear of this further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He signed; the writer spoke to the Kjermanash, while the mate
glared venom at them, his glances darting from one to the other.
The seamen seemed hesitant, especially the fat young one, to
whom the writer chiefly addressed himself. Though Rodvard could
not understand a word, the voice-lilt told clearly enough how the
tale was going. Now the lad began to catch at his breath and
sniffle, saying a few more words. The mate&rsquo;s head turned slowly
round (hardest murder staring from his eyes), while his hand slid,
slid toward belt and knife&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Rodvard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to kill him!&rdquo; The mate leaped
snarling to his feet, bringing out the knife with the same motion, but
Rodvard&rsquo;s shout had quickened the guards. One stepped forward,
striking with his truncheon, while the other seized his man from
behind, arm around neck. A roar from the mate, squeaks from the
Kjermanash, and with a crash of heavy bodies, the big man was
down and firmly held, cursing and trying to wring a broken hand.
One of the Initiates said serenely; &ldquo;This is an act of self-accusation&rdquo;;
then to the writer; &ldquo;Do these also accuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Brother. The lesser one says that he has been this captain&rsquo;s
catamite and that Ser Bergelin was cabin-keeper to the
captain and must have been solicited to such purpose, for this
was his custom with all. They say further that an order was given
to throw Ser Bergelin into the sea. Further, they say they were
instructed as to what they should report on the repairing of the
mast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_356">356</div>
<p>&ldquo;Love is illumination,&rdquo; said the Initiate. His companion; &ldquo;Our
decision is that this mate shall pay a fine of ten Dossolan scudi for
ruffling the peace of this court; but for having brought false accusations
against one under the protection of the Prophet, he shall be
submitted to detention of the body and instruction in doctrine until
such time as the court shall release him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate gave a yell. &ldquo;I protest,&rdquo; said the well-dressed ambassador,
&ldquo;against the condemnation of one of our gracious Queen&rsquo;s
subjects on perjured evidence and as the result of the actions of
one who is not only himself a criminal, but a provocator of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your protest is recorded. We declare the business of this case
has been dispatched.&rdquo; The two Initiates rose as though their
muscles were controlled by a single mind, but as the Dossolan
rose also and the guards frogmarched their prisoner out, one of
them looked at Rodvard. &ldquo;You will remain, young man,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>They sat down again. One of them said; &ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; and the
pair stared at him unmoving with those impassive eyes. The inspection
lasted a good three or four minutes; Rodvard itched and
hardly dared to squirm. One of them addressed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bear a Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It was not a question, but a statement; Rodvard did not feel
an answer called for, therefore made none.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be warned,&rdquo; said the second Initiate, &ldquo;that it is somewhat less
potent here than elsewhere, since it is the command of the God
of love that all shall deal in truth, and therefore there is little hidden
for it to reveal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; began Rodvard. The Initiate held up his hand for
silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless you thought that your charm permitted you to read
all that is in the mind. Learn, young man, that the value of this
stone being founded on witchery and evil, will teach you only the
thoughts that stem from the Evil god; as hatred, licentiousness,
cruelty, deception, murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Rodvard was silent (thinking swiftly that this might be
true, that although he was no veteran of this jewel, it had never
told him anything good about anyone).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your witch?&rdquo; said one of the Initiates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Dossola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be impossible for you to return there with the case of
today&rsquo;s court standing against you, and the mate of your ship in
our detention, by our necessary action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, in time&mdash;&rdquo; began Rodvard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_357">357</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can you well bring her here,&rdquo; said the other Initiate. &ldquo;The
practice of witchery is not forbidden among us as it is by the laws
of your country. But we hold it to be a sin against the God of
love, and it is required that those found in witchery undergo a
period of instruction in the couvertines of the Myonessae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A wild wave of longing for Lalette swept across him, drowning
the formless regret of leaving behind the Sons of the New
Day&mdash;a new life&mdash;an empty life&mdash;&ldquo;No spirit in it,&rdquo; the old man had
said.) Before Rodvard could think of anything to say, one of the
Initiates spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All life in this material world is a turning from one void to
another, and shall be escaped only by filling the void with love.
And this is the essence of Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A jar like a fall from a height told him that he was facing
men who could follow his thought almost as clearly as he could
that of others, and Rodvard half thought of how the butler at
Sedad Vix had said it was possible to conceal one&rsquo;s thoughts; half
wondered what these strange men wanted with him.) The strong,
resonant voice went on; &ldquo;It is not the thought of the mind, but
the purpose of the heart for which we seek; for the mind is as
material as the world on which it looks&mdash;a creature of evil&mdash;while
the other is arcane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the second Initiate, as though this matter had now been
settled; &ldquo;What is your profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a clerk. I was in the Office of Pedigree at Netznegon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we have no pedigrees. Soil-tillers are needed; but if you
lack the skill or desire for such labor, you may serve in the commercial
counter which places for sale the products of the Prophet&rsquo;s
benevolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I would prefer the second,&rdquo; said Rodvard (not really
thinking it at all; for tillage and commercial clerkship, he held to
be equal miseries, yet the latter might offer a better chance of
release).</p>
<p>The Initiates stood up. &ldquo;We will inform the stylarion at the
door, who will find you harborage and instruct you where you are
to report for work. You must give him your money of Dossolan
coinage, which he will replace with that of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no money of any coinage, none at all,&rdquo; said Rodvard.</p>
<p>The two stopped in their progress toward the door and turned
on him faces which, for the first time, were struck with frown.
One of them said severely; &ldquo;Young man, you have evidently been
under the control of the god of Evil. Unless this financial stringency
disappears, we shall be required to order that you take doctrinal
instruction; and it were better if you did so in any case. The
stylarion will give you a warrant for new garments and your other
immediate needs, but all must be strictly repaid, and within no
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_358">358</div>
<p>They left. Rodvard thought their final remarks a very strange
pendant to the generosity they had otherwise shown; and wondered
unhappily whether he would ever see Lalette again.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The lodging assigned was in a room over the shop of a tailor
named Gualdis, at a corner where three streets ran together. The
man had a fat wife and three daughters, one of whom brought
from a cookshop on the corner a big dish of lentils and greens
with bits of sausage through it, from which they all ate together.
The girls chartered profusely, curious as so many magpies about
Rodvard and how life was lived in Dossola, for they were too
young to remember when Prince Pavinius had turned from Grand
Governor to Prophet and the Tritulaccan war began.</p>
<p>Rodvard liked the middle one best; called Leece. She had
thick and vividly black eyebrows that gave her eyes a sparkle
when she laughed, which was frequently. (The Blue Star told
him that behind the sparkle crouched a kind of dumb question
whether he might not be the destined man, and the thought of
being sought by her was not unpleasant to him, but she turned
her head so rapidly and talked so much that he could make out
no more.)</p>
<p>After he had been shown to his bed, the usual sleeplessness of
a changed condition of life came to him, and he began to examine
his thoughts. He felt happy beneath all, and doubting whether he
were entitled to, searched for some background of the sense of
approaching peril which had held him the night Lalette came to
his pensionnario door, and again when he spoke with Tuol&eacute;n the
butler. But it was nowhere; all seemed well in spite of the fact that
he was more or less a prisoner in this land. The common report
had it that this was not an unusual experience, that Amorosian
agents circulated all through the homeland, recruiting for their
own purposes especially those with any touch of witchery, and
he thought that might be true. The Initiate on the ship had taken
him very readily into protection, and if he were like those in the
court, must have known that Rodvard bore a Blue Star.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_359">359</div>
<p>Yet it seemed to him that these Amorosians were so well disposed
toward each other that one might do worse to live out a
life among them, in spite of a certain unearthliness among their
Initiates. Now also he began to look back toward Dossola and to
understand why it was that Mancherei should be so hated, most
particularly by the upper orders. For it seemed that if he could
but return, persuade Remigorius, Mathurin and the rest how the
people of the Prophet lived among themselves, the Sons of the
New Day might fulfill their mission by striking an alliance in
Mancherei. No, never (he answered himself); that would be to
set the son above the parent, the colony over the homeland, and
politic would never permit it.</p>
<p>Yet was it not cardinal in the thinking of the Sons of the New
Day that to hold such a thing wrong was in itself wrong? The
evil in the old rule was that it set one man above another for no
other reason but his birth. Was not Pyax the Zigraner, with his odd
smell and slanted eye, entitled to as much consideration as Baron
Brunivar? Why not then, up with the standard of Mancherei and
its Prophet? For that, what had Pavinius found so wrong in this
place that he had deserted the very rule he founded?</p>
<p>Rodvard twisted in his bed, and thought&mdash;of course; I have
been slow indeed to miss the flaw. For though there were no
episcopals here, the Initiates surely filled their office. If freedom
from tyranny were won only by making episcopals into judges,
then it was only a viler slavery. Was life, then, a question of
whether spirit or body should be free? But on this question Rodvard
found himself becoming so involved that he went to sleep, and
did not wake till day burned behind the shutters.</p>
<p>Leece brought him his breakfast on a tray and wished him a
merry morning, but when he would have spoken to her, said she
must hurry to her employ. (Her eyes had some message he could
not quite read; if the Initiates were right, it would be a gentle one,
and kindly.) His mind was more on her than on his new fortune
as he went forth, and he missed a turning in the streets, so that
his task began badly with a tardy arrival.</p>
<p>The building of his toil, like so many in Charalkis, was new
and of brick, with mullioned windows along the street front and
a low, wide door at one side, through which carts passed empty
to pick up bales at a platform within. Rodvard entered to see a
row of clerks on stools sitting before a single long desk and writing
away as though for dear life. A short, round man paced up and
down nervously behind them, now and again speaking to one of
the writers, or hearing a question from another.</p>
<p>This short man came over to Rodvard and looked up and down
his length. &ldquo;I am the protostylarion,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Are you
Bergelin, the Dossolan clerk? You are in retard by a third of a
glass. The fine is two obulas. Come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_360">360</div>
<p>He led down to the inner end of the desk, where under the
least light stood a vacant stool. &ldquo;Here is your place. For the beginning,
you have the task of posting to the records of individual
couvertines from those of the general sales by ships. Here&mdash;this
is a ship&rsquo;s manifest from a voyage to Tritulacca. Three clocks from
the couvertine Arpik, as you see, have been sold for eight reuls
Tritulaccan. You will open a sheet for Arpik, on which noting this
fact, one sheet for each couvertine, then place a mark here to
show that the matter is cared for, not pausing to translate&mdash;yes,
Ivrigo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interrupter held his ledger in hand and diddled from foot
to foot, as though being held from a cabinet of ease. &ldquo;Oh, Ser
Maltusz, I crave pardon, but I cannot carry through this posting
according to system until I have a ruling on where falls the sea-loss
in such a case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, let me see&mdash;why, stupidity, look there! It is plainly stated
that no offer had been made on the said lost bales. They were
therefore couvertine goods still, and not regarding whether the
loss were caused by piracy or not, it must fall there.&rdquo; He turned
back to Rodvard. &ldquo;Do not try to translate into our money, for that
is the function of another. You are expected to finish this manifest
by evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never done this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work is prayer. There is the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">19</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TWO CHOICES</span></h2>
<p>The stern-faced mattern&rsquo;s name was Dame Quasso; she told
Mircella to show Lalette to a small brown room angled by a
dormer, where a bed with one blanket, a chair and a chiffonier
were the only furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dress-room is down here,&rdquo; said the servant, pointing. &ldquo;The
regulation is that all demoiselles stir themselves together at the
ringing of the morning-bell, so that the day&rsquo;s tasks may be
assigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Lalette, sitting down on the edge of the bed (so
glad to hear a voice without malice or innuendo in it that the
words hardly mattered).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">361</div>
<p>The eyes were round and the mouth was round; a series of
rounds. Said Mircella; &ldquo;It is the regulation. . . . You must dress
your best for evening. It is the day of the diaconals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some of them are quite rich. We will have roast meat for
supper. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if one of them would take you way
up in the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette felt her heart contract. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;I am from Dossola, and this is all new to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the diaconals. Those learners who are in the second
stage, almost Initiates, so they can&rsquo;t be married, and once a month
they come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mircella!&rdquo; came Dame Quasso&rsquo;s voice, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go. You won&rsquo;t have to work today. You never do on
the first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette thought: what trap am I caught in? It was a diaconal
that Tegval said he was, and that he had chosen me, that horrible
night when&mdash;when&mdash;. A fierce surge of anger burned through her
at the widow Domijaiek, who had babbled so of love and God, yet
brought her to this dubious resort; and once more, as when she
stood in the mask-maker&rsquo;s parlor, there was the feeling of being
hemmed in by metal walls. But before her fury could rise to the
performing of the black witchery already forming at the back of
her mind, the door was tapped and a toothless old man brought
in her chest and said Dame Quasso awaited her attendance.</p>
<p>The entrance broke a spell; Lalette was inwardly assuring
herself there was some mistake, the thing might be better than
appearances, while the mattern began in the most ordinary way to
ask her what work she had done or might be fitted for. At last
Dame Quasso said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what you Dossolan girls are trained for by
your mothers, except marriage to counts. No one of you can earn
the worth of her clothing. You know nothing; but I will place you
with the stitchers who work on linen till you have learned something
better. You will find your witchery of little value here. I
suppose the charge is justified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette stamped her foot (all the fury returning at this treatment).
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;as I was brought up, a girl sold
into prostitution had already earned the worth of her clothing and
something else beside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_362">362</div>
<p>There was a silence, in which the cool, hard eyes did not
change, nor the face around them (and Lalette had the sensation
that if she looked into them any longer, she would drown). Dame
Quasso said; &ldquo;Sit down. . . . We have had girls like you before,
and always they make me doubtful of those who admit you to the
company of the Myonessae. Nevertheless, it is our task, who conduct
these couvertines, to see that you are instructed to a better
way of life. Listen attentively; there is in this domain of Mancherei
and in our honorable order no question of prostitution, which concerns
those who sell for money what they should give for love.
But it is the wise ordinance of our Prophet that they who would
attain to the state of Initiates shall not marry before quitting this
material body for that life which is the God of love. For marriage
is viewed with approval by the old churches as though it were
something to be desired. Yet it is but a license to serve the god
of Evil, in whose armory no weapon is so potent as the propagation
of further mankind into this bodily world, which he wholly rules.
Therefore it is ordered that when one who has reached the diaconal
estate is overcome by the desires which the god of Evil has
placed in all flesh, he shall seek out the Myonessae, choose one,
and cohabit with her for as long as they both will. It is a matter
of free choice and no compulsion. Yet during such time, the diaconal
is not allowed to continue his studies, thus standing in
danger of never becoming Initiate, but of dying and being reborn
into some ugly form, as a serpent or an insect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Lalette, nipping a lip in her little white teeth; &ldquo;And what
of us, who merely satisfy the lusts of these men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From severity, the mattern&rsquo;s face turned to astonishment. &ldquo;Why,
this is the very service of love, that we offer our bodies, not in
exchange for the sustainment a man gives us and the satisfaction
of our own desires, but in the name of the love of God, that all
may benefit by learning the vanity of earthly wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not told of this, and I do not think I like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Quasso&rsquo;s face turned stern again. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said
in an iron voice. &ldquo;There are some who will not accept instruction.
I will have the account made up of what you owe for the passage
here. When it is paid, you may have a porter take your box
wherever you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Where, indeed? And how pay? Panic mingled with the anger
that boiled anew in Lalette&rsquo;s mind.) &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you talk of
love and holiness, and&mdash;&rdquo; then burst into tears, leaning forward
with her hands covering her face. The mattern came around and
placed a surprisingly gentle hand on the girl&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_363">363</div>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is not I nor the Initiates of Mancherei
that place you under hard compulsion, but this material world,
in which the god of Evil has all power. All you have learned, all
you have gained through witchery is straight from hell. Return to
your room; meditate what I have said until supper, when some of
the diaconals will come, and see for yourself whether it is as sour
a fate to be of the Myonessae as you now think.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Rodvard had no meal at noon (lacking money), his eyeballs
ached from toiling under lamplight, and the others had finished
their eating when he reached the Gualdis&rsquo; shop. The dame&rsquo;s voice
was not very pleasant (the Blue Star told him she hoped he was
not going to be as much trouble as&mdash;something he could not make
out). But Leece and Vyana, the oldest daughter, reheated for him
some of the stew in a casserole, and made to entertain him by
asking him about his work. (When he told them it was casting
accounts for the Myonessae, there was something behind Vyana&rsquo;s
eyes that came to him as a shapeless whirl of fear and desire, but
he could neither draw her thought more clear, nor cause the subject
to be pursued.)</p>
<p>Now the talk turned to Dossola, and especially to Count Cleudi,
for the whole family became much excited when they learned
Rodvard had actually seen that famous person in the flesh and
even worked for him. It took him several moments to realize that
here in Mancherei he need not withhold his tongue, for these
people thought the Count as great a villain as did the Sons of the
New Day. Rodvard related the trick Cleudi had played on Aiella
of Arjen (keeping his own name out of it for a reason he did not
quite know), whereupon Leece asked innocently what a &ldquo;mistress&rdquo;
might be, and the elders laughed.</p>
<p>His own room was very small, with the window right over the
bed and only space for a garderobe, a cabinet and one chair. The
next morning the girl brought his breakfast very early, and it
needed no Blue Star to see that she wanted to talk, so he made
her sit on the chair and took the tray across his knees, as he asked
why Vyana had been so strange about the Myonessae the night
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her sweetheart is a learner who has now become diaconal and
wishes to join the sisterhood. But father and mother want her to
marry in the usual way.&rdquo; She leaned close and in a voice that was
little above a whisper said; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell, will you? . . . But we
are afraid he&rsquo;ll bring an Initiate to persuade them, and then he&rsquo;ll
find out that father and mother really believe in the old religion,
and he&rsquo;ll send both of them away for instruction, and all three of
us will have to go into the Myonessae, and I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_364">364</div>
<p>(So many questions whirled in Rodvard&rsquo;s head that he could
not find words fast enough; and all his senses were tingling with
the sudden nearness of Leece&rsquo;s red lips, the swelling breasts and
the message that darted from her eyes, saying she was pleased
with this same nearness, but not as Damaris the maid, she held
herself high and. . . .) He said, rather stupidly, not thinking of
his words; &ldquo;And why not? I would think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned back again; (the eyes went dead) the thick brows
came together. &ldquo;Ah, but you do not think like a woman. We&mdash;we&mdash;want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, charming Leece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flashed a smile which accepted his tiny apology and announced
they two would play the game so set in motion. &ldquo;We
want to be loved for ourselves, here in this world. There! I have
said it. Now, when you make your fourth-day report before the
stylarion, you have only to complain that I am out of the law of
Love, and they&rsquo;ll send me somewhere for instruction, and you
won&rsquo;t have to be bothered with my questions about Dossola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend the day! But tell me, Leece, is it contrary to the law
not to be Amorosian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t understand. It isn&rsquo;t that hard, really. Only
the Initiates have to see that people don&rsquo;t do wrong things, and
doing something wrong always begins with thinking, so they send
people away for instruction when they begin to think the wrong
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rattled this off like a lesson learned. Rodvard said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who decides whether the Initiates themselves are right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they have to be! They learn everything through the God
of love, and one of them couldn&rsquo;t be wrong without the others
finding it out. That was how they found out that the Prophet was
falling under the power of the god of Evil, when he tried to change
everything and had to leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard picked at the bedcover for a moment (deciding it
was as well to change the subject). &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;why can&rsquo;t your
Myonessae be loved for themselves? I am only two days here, and
know so little about your customs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the diaconals who choose them, you mean? Ah, no. All the
Myonessae know they are only second choice. The diaconals have
already chosen the service of the God of love first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Myonessae are jealous of the church&mdash;or of your
God of love?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">365</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Women think more spiritually than men. You must
go to a service with me and then you&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo; The corner
of her mouth twitched slightly; she reached over to touch his
hand. &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said, and was gone.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a custom, by which she came to
him each morning to be his instructor in all that concerned Mancherei.
Once or twice fat Dame Gualdis wheezed up the stair and
smiled through the door at the two, wishing them good morning
as she went past on some errand, real or pretended; she seemed
to find it decorous that the girl often sat on the edge of Rodvard&rsquo;s
bed. Their conversation never seemed to fail, and they took delight
in minor contacts, as when he showed Leece the fashion of
sitting wrestle he had learned as a lad, with each opponent gripping
the other&rsquo;s right elbow and only that arm engaged. Leece
was so nearly as strong as himself as to make the contest a true
one (and she was as greedy as he of the almost-meeting of bodies,
as the Blue Star told him. She would go a long way with him, it
said, perhaps all the way if pressed, but felt a little fearful of her
own desires, and would want him as a husband in permanence.
When she left, he would think of Damaris the maid as he dressed,
and how she also had sat on his bed, and the end of that meeting,
sweet and terrifying, how she had killed his Blue Star, and how
he would surely have been trapped into some regular connection
with her, had not circumstance ordered his flight from Sedad Vix.
At this it seemed to him, walking the street to his daily toil, that
there was nothing in the world so precious as that jewel and the
use to which it must be put, and he must reach Dossola again, and
by no means do the thing that would rob the Blue Star of its virtue;
and then he thought of the penalty Lalette had promised,
which lay at the back of his mind like a dark cloud of dread. But
as he took his place on his stool, the thought came that he had
already earned whatever penalty there was. It was not credible
that the accident of having the Star&rsquo;s power restored by the old
woman in the hut would disannul what he had to bear; nor was
it likely that the restoration would hide his action from one possessed
of the witch-powers of the far-away girl to whom he was
bound. But why was he bound to Lalette? Now the sweetness of
the touch of Leece and the desire of her body ran through him
like a liquid fire, and he felt as though he were running across
a bridge no wider than a knife-blade over a yawning chasm, toward
a goal hidden in mist, and all his inner organs were wrung.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bergelin!&rdquo; said the protostylarion. &ldquo;You will remember that
this work is given to you as a charity, which it will profit you not
to abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_366">366</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">20</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">INEVITABLE</span></h2>
<p>Another girl was already before the mirror in the dress-room,
running a comb through fair hair; taller than Lalette. She looked
over her shoulder at the newcomer with an expression not unlike
that of a satisfied cat and went on with her task, humming a little
tune; Lalette felt that she was being asked to speak first. &ldquo;Your
pardon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I have just come. Can you tell me where
the soap is kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall girl surveyed her. &ldquo;We use our own,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
if you have not brought any, you may take some of mine tonight.
In the black-dressing-box, there on the table&mdash;that is, if you do
not mind violet scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you. I didn&rsquo;t mean . . . My name is Lalette&rdquo; (again
the hesitation, a momentary question whether to say &ldquo;Bergelin&rdquo;
here, but that was all dead and gone, she would never see him
again) &ldquo;Asterhax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Nanhilde. We don&rsquo;t use second names in the
Myonessae unless we have been married. Have you, ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must get rid of old-fashioned prejudices in a place
like this. I used to think that being married was something I
wanted so much; but it isn&rsquo;t really. It only chains you to some man,
and next thing you know, you&rsquo;re sewing jackets and raising brats
for him. You wait till you&rsquo;re chosen; he&rsquo;ll want to marry you and
give up being an Initiate. They always do, and if you say yes,
you&rsquo;re lost, not your own mistress any more, and he&rsquo;ll always
blame you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette had been washing her face. Now she lifted it from the
towel in time to catch the middle term of the series. &ldquo;But are you&mdash;are
we of the Myonessae prevented from having children, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a greenie, aren&rsquo;t you? Of course, not; only we don&rsquo;t
have to snivel around any man for their upkeep. There&rsquo;s a couvertine
for that. I have one there now; the diaconal who fathered
him on me had his miniature painted and I&rsquo;ll show it to you.
Hurry with your dress and we&rsquo;ll go down together. Old quince-face
doesn&rsquo;t like anybody to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_367">367</div>
<p>She took Lalette&rsquo;s arm and guided her along a hall already
powder-grey with dusk, to the stairwell, where the racking note
of a violin floated in a funnel of light. Below, it was all so different
than Lalette had seen it in the morning, or even at noon, when
she had eaten a rather gloomy meal of pulse and one apple, while
the others around her chattered in a subdued manner under the
eye of Dame Quasso. The whole place was now gay with lamps
and someone had hung spring branches among them, under which
girls were gathered in excited little groups, some of them talking
to young men, the ruffles of their dresses vibrating, as though
they too had caught the mood of animation. Among the moving
heads Lalette could see how the double doors of the eating-hall
were flung wide; at its entry the mattern stood, talking with a
white-headed man dressed in grey, whose expression never changed.
Dame Quasso beckoned; as Lalette worked her way in that direction,
a voice floated past, &ldquo;. . . I told her he already said he would
choose me, and I don&rsquo;t care if I do lose my place, I&rsquo;m going to
ask for an Initiate&rsquo;s trial. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes looked down into hers from a height. &ldquo;This is our
newest member, called Lalette,&rdquo; said the mattern. &ldquo;She is from
Dossola, where she was accused of witchery, and she is somewhat
troubled in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long gaze. The grey man said; &ldquo;It is because she feels compelled
and has not learned the wonderful freedom of the service
of the God of love. My child, witches find it harder than anyone
else to forget the material self, but once they do so, attain the
most surely to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Perfection? Lalette wanted to cry that it was no desire of
hers.) She said; &ldquo;The material self? I don&rsquo;t really care what I eat&mdash;or
where I sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grey man said; &ldquo;Do not think in mere terms of nourishment,
which is a means of maintaining the material body we despise.
In love, we serve the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Lalette felt her inner gorge rising toward forbidden anger.)
&ldquo;I am not sure I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be troubled. Many fail to understand in the beginning,
and to many, perfection comes after a long struggle in self-denial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rebecks and flutes broke out, all in tune. Dame Quasso
offered her arm to the grey man and Lalette looked around to see
other pairings, two and two, moving into the eating-hall. She herself
was suddenly left unattended, to go in with the blonde Nanhilde.
The taller girl leaned close and said; &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_368">368</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Lalette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody. Not an obula tonight,&rdquo; replied Nanhilde.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Leece. &ldquo;Oh, hear. I am not ignorant. If you really
desire that I should come no more, I will not. I am not one to
intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely Leece,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is for you, not I,&rdquo; (yet knowing
it was for himself) and drew her hand to his lips, folding her
fingers round the kiss he placed in the palm.</p>
<p>She looked at him intently. &ldquo;There is a cold breeze,&rdquo; she said,
and stepping to the door, closed it before she ran across the room
with little quick steps to throw back the covers and slip in beside
him. The black brows brushed his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hated me and really wanted to get rid of me, let me
ask you, what would you do? How different would you behave
toward me than you are now doing? You tell me that talking with
you here in the morning gives you pleasure and is a help to you.
Why do you wish to stop it then, if I am willing to come? And
if you are thinking of any danger to me, why surely that is my
concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As her arm came around his neck and their lips met in the
long deep kiss, he closed his eyes, not daring to look into hers, for
this was no Damaris the maid (and it was not that he dared not,
but that he would not). They came shuddering from the contact.
&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; he cried and drew her close again and for a third time.
But then she said suddenly; &ldquo;Three is enough,&rdquo; and without another
word slipped from beside him and was gone.</p>
<p>All nights were now turned into a prelude to the mornings,
and all days to a prelude for the evenings, when one of the other
sisters would talk with them and gently jest at them for a pair of
lovers, until Rodvard and Leece went out for a stroll under avenues
of plane-trees, where lights flickered through the leaves in the
warm summer air. The elder Vyana or the younger Madaille often
accompanied them on these journeys, laughing a great deal as they
conversed on matters of no importance, for it was as though he
and Leece had signed a treaty never to show anyone outside how
deeply they were concerned with each other. In the mornings,
when the subject turned to themselves, there were checks and
uncertainties in their words; yet it was a topic they could not avoid.
Rodvard would often leave his breakfast uneaten, the better to
lie beside her, kissing and kissing, with now and then some little
thing said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_369">369</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must not love me,&rdquo; she whispered one morning, turning
her burning face from his; &ldquo;not in the human way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Leece? I love&mdash;this,&rdquo; and kissed her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so do I. But to love, to love&mdash;it would be falling into the
hands of the Evil god for me to love you or you to love me,
before you had been to instruction and accepted the doctrine of
the Prophet. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not (nor, when he broke the rule he had set on himself
and looked into her eyes, could he read behind them any illumination).
&ldquo;I am not sure I want to be an Amorosian,&rdquo; he said,
gravely, &ldquo;but if you say I shall not love you, I will try not to.
Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged him close then, and her lips sought his to end this,
and to say without words that this commerce of theirs was a
pleasure for its own sake and might be brought to destruction by
any talk of a deeper relation&mdash;or so he reasoned out her action,
that night, as he lay in the hour between waking and sleep. The
pleasure of it was so sweet that he dared do nothing to change
the pattern; though when she tried to tell him of the strange religion
of the Prophet, he would change the conversation to the
mystery of their mutual attraction&mdash;in the midst of which a vertigo
of kissing and clasping would come upon them and there would
be silence for a long time. The door was always closed now;
sometimes the footsteps of Dame Gualdis could be heard outside,
but after the first time, when Leece slipped from the bed in panic,
they paid no attention, for the mother neither knocked nor entered.
Only when the steps sounded, Leece would gently hold
his hand to make him cease fondling her breasts, which she now
allowed him freely to do at all times, lying with dark lashes on
her cheek and lips half parted.</p>
<p>She would not let him go further than this, nor did the cold
Blue Star speak of any willingness to do so. When once, with
senses reeling, he would have pressed the matter on, she said no,
someone might come, there was no time, and made other excuses,
though she kissed him as she said it, and caressed him with curious
fingers. Yet it had become part of an unspoken agreement between
them that he should ask for no more, only kiss her and be
as bold as she permitted; and it was she who ultimately brought
the matter into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were married, you could have me whenever you wished.&rdquo;
She said it half regretfully (and he did look this time, catching
behind her eyes something like a color, something that spoke of a
desire in her, though somehow not of the same kind as his own).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_370">370</div>
<p>By the convention into which they had fallen, he must now
clasp her eagerly and say, &ldquo;Ah, Leece,&rdquo; and kiss her for a long
time, before saying; &ldquo;Yet if we did marry, and the mixture proved
imperfect, consider how we might hate each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to kiss you,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Vyana cried last night.
She saw him in the afternoon, and does not know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel my heart beat,&rdquo; he said, placing her hand over it. &ldquo;It
would seem to me that she and her lover are really meant for a
perfect union. Could she not enter the Myonessae and be chosen
and persuade him to marriage afterward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl went stiff in his arms, looking at him with eyes wide
in astonishment. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that would be deception and
sin&mdash;leading him from the service of the God of love to Evil. Oh,
Rodvard, never say such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a true trembling in her voice and he felt the moisture
of a tear, where her face was pressed into the crotch of his neck.
(It did not seem to him that a chance remark was a matter for
such fervor, for as he knew religion, it was a guide, and the world
would go mad if one tried to observe its commands in every particular.)
But all this was only the background of a flicker of
surprise across his mind, as he left her face and kissed her closed
eyes. &ldquo;Leece, Leece,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; and did not know
what more to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rodvard, I could not bear it if you deceived me like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am trying to?&rdquo; (Kiss.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. No. Ah, we must not do this. It leads us into
the hands of Evil. Rodvard, Rodvard, you must, if you want me.
. . . Oh&mdash;&rdquo; The word died into lips moving without sound, on
which his lips closed, her breath began to come fast, she let his
seeking fingers linger a moment at her breasts and slide past, he
could not see her eyes, but without the intervention of his amulet,
he knew that this was the moment&mdash;but at the very point of sliding
from the crest, Leece flung herself gasping from his arms, and
with a sob was gone.</p>
<p>Next morning his breakfast was left outside the door.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The linen stitching was very tedious. Five or six of them, all
novices like herself, sat in a circle and went round the edges of
napkins, drawing three threads, stitching them home, drawing
three threads, bringing them home again, while the mattern or
Mircella or one of the older girls read slowly from the First Book
of the Prophet, pausing now and again to make exposition of the
meaning of a passage. Talking was discouraged. At noon there
was always the same meal of pulse with fresh greens or fruit, but
in the evening sometimes a piece of meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_371">371</div>
<p>Every fourth-day they all marched in procession to the house
of religion and there was a service, not like those in the Dossolan
churches, with their flowers and music, but merely a discourse,
such as Lalette had first heard at the conventicle in Netznegon,
with everybody embracing each other afterward, and prayers of
grace pronounced by an Initiate. This took place at noon; after
the service, no more work was done on these days.</p>
<p>After dinner and on the free afternoons, all were at liberty
except for such matters as personal laundry. Most of the girls
walked two and two for a while in the garden, where tall alleys
of hollyhocks divided the vegetable plots on which some of the
Myonessae labored during the day. Going on, out into the street
was not forbidden, but not encouraged. Neither&mdash;as Lalette quickly
discovered&mdash;was it very pleasant, for although these people of
Mancherei had no badges of status, which at first seemed a very
strange thing, everybody seemed to know at once that she was
one of the sisterhood. This was all right as to older people, but
in the half-twilight, young men would call out to her, or what was
worse, sidle alongside her on the pave and try to make conversation,
or offer a glass of wine.</p>
<p>She found their insinuation so infuriating that the second time
this happened, with the fellow almost directly making an insinuation,
only the memory of Tegval kept her from putting a witchery
on him then and there. Dame Quasso had been walking
in the garden that night. As Lalette came hurrying through the
gate, she looked so long and intently that it seemed she must
somehow have caught part of the Initiates&rsquo; trick of thought-reading,
and to Lalette&rsquo;s other troubles was added the fear of being
known for a murderess.</p>
<p>On this night of all, the blonde Nanhilde would choose to
come to her room for a talk, babbling against the clerks of account,
who had allowed her far less than she deserved for some broideries
she had done; &ldquo;&mdash;and they gave &rsquo;Zina just double my price. I know
what it is; she slips out of here on fourth-days and gets drunk
with some of those clerks and lets them do anything they want.
She&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette (upset, and wanting to talk about anything but this);
&ldquo;But how can she keep the mattern from knowing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_372">372</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is careful. A girl has to be in this place. She always
gets back before bedtime, and her sister in town says she spends
the afternoons there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette sighed. &ldquo;I thought, when I came here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nanhilde said; &ldquo;What did you expect to be different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s hands fluttered. &ldquo;Is there no way we can escape from
the overwhelming lusts of men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl in the Myonessae can do very well if she does not fear
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette burst into tears.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">21</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MIDWINTER: THE RETURN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Make up this account for closing,&rdquo; said the protostylarion,
handing Rodvard a dossier which bore the endorsement: &ldquo;Approved
to expel the subject from the Myonessae for contumacious refusal
to accept any choice&mdash;Tradit, I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard dragged weary feet to the bench, for his night had
been sleepless, with this matter of Leece reaching a crisis. All
week, she had striven to pretend in the presence of others that
nothing was changed, but would neither bring his breakfast, nor
allow him any opportunity to speak with her alone in the evening.
A crisis&mdash;the sleepless night began when he had refused to walk
with her and Vyana under planes still clinging to their last
leaves, then felt unhappy over the look of a friend betrayed that
came into her eyes. A crisis; for that look was a trap as grim as
the one the witch had set for him. He did not really want the
dark-browed Leece (he told himself), overall, at the price of
permanent union she set upon her body. It would have been, it
was, enough merely to talk with her and be gay companions, as
he was with the other sisters. Only the moments when a contact
of lips or body sent a devouring flame along his veins were different.
Yet there was now upon him a compulsion to find the next
move in the game and carry it through, as though he were involved
in a complex dance and dared not miss a pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">373</div>
<p>What is this, then? (he asked himself). Am I a mechanician&rsquo;s
instrument, or so weak I am not my own master? Is it that I owe
her a duty, and by what sanction am I held thereto? The priest
at the academy might have had an answer for that. He would have
said that the sanction was of God, &ldquo;who sends us all peace, so that
even those misguided men who say there is no God must make an
inner peace, through a claim to be true to some image of the
Ideal, which they call themselves. So that God is not balked, but
enters in them unawares, and they only make their own path
harder by reaching Him through devious ways instead of simple.&rdquo;
He could remember the argument accurately, and how its force
had once struck him. Thus the priest, then; but if the sanction was
of God, did God (Rodvard now asked himself) urge him to this
pursuit of Leece? No matter what; he knew that when he reached
the Gualdis&rsquo; house that night, the intricate pavanne would continue,
and he a part of it as before.</p>
<p>Leave then. No. Not in this land, where he was a public
prisoner, required still to report on every tenth day, an irritating
routine. For that matter, leave for where? Not Dossola, with the
prosecution hanging over his head; not any other place. Dance
out the dance.</p>
<p>The protostylarion&rsquo;s step roused him from reverie. He opened
the dossier and with a feeling of vertigo, perceived that it was
from the couvertine Lolau: &ldquo;&mdash;on the account of the Myonessan
Lalette Asterhax.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Without a knock the door opened, Leece slipped in and stood
with her back to it, looking down. Rodvard began hastily to make
good his jacket-laces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; she said in a thin voice, then hurriedly;
&ldquo;What I did was contrary to the law of love. Do you want me to
bring your breakfast in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were veiled, but one could guess what lay behind
them (and one must&mdash;one must tread the right measure). &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran across the room and seized her in his arms, so she let
her dark head slide down against his neck. &ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo;
kissing her ear and the side of her neck (yet at the same time
feeling a revulsion almost physical, and all the time the thought of
that other was at the back of his mind, not coming forward because
he dared not let it).</p>
<p>A sudden tenseness was in her grip; she flung her head back
and looked at him (out of eyes that spoke distrust). &ldquo;Rodvard!
What is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. We must hurry and go to supper or they will miss
us.&rdquo; A rivulet of perspiration coursed down his spine. She kissed
him long and hard (with the doubt still there) and was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>Afterward it was the tall Vyana who went to walk with them.
Leece took his hand; all gay, but casting glances that seemed to
show an unasked question in her mind (so that Rodvard wondered
whether she might not have some part of the Blue Star&rsquo;s
gift). He said to Vyana; &ldquo;Tell me something. If you were in the
Myonessae, how could I come to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face fell sober. &ldquo;I am not a Myonessan yet. But if I were,
it would not be easy unless you became at least a learner. The
Myonessans have no contacts with the outer world save those
they make themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange rule,&rdquo; he said, not daring to push the matter further
lest he betray his thought.</p>
<p>Now Leece spoke, trying to justify the regimen under which
the girls lived, but Vyana, being so near to the sisterhood, was
doubtful, and Rodvard heard both of them with only part of his
mind, considering what he must do. There was no question but
he must do it, ah, no; the expelled of the Myonessae, he knew well,
were shut away in gloomy prisons for &ldquo;instruction&rdquo;, it might be
for years. The couvertine Lolau was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;do you not think so, Rodvard?&rdquo; said Leece&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry. I was thinking of a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All her attention and affection suddenly rushed at him; she
pressed his hand hard. &ldquo;I was only saying&mdash;&rdquo; and in spite of that
warm grip, his mind went off again under the babble. The Blue
Star would perhaps let him make his way in, if the light were good&mdash;and
they reached the door. Leece squeezed his hand again,
possessively; he knew she would have sought a corner and kissed
him, but he managed to avoid that, with a certain shame picking
at him.</p>
<p>Inside he went rapidly upstairs, then stood tingling in his own
room as outer steps went to and fro. His mind toiled at details&mdash;the
lock of the street-door was a heavy one, usually turning with
a grating sound, he must have a story ready to tell if someone
woke and asked him questions. But before he could work out a
tale the small sounds died to a single series of pat, pat, pat, and
he had a moment of dreadful fear and excitement mingled that it
might be Leece, coming to him that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">375</div>
<p>This was his turning-point in life (he thought) and the choice
was being made from outside himself. The steps went past; Rodvard
released his breath, sat down and, trying to use up the time
until all should be asleep, began to repeat to himself Iren Dostal&rsquo;s
ballad of the archer and the bear. But at the third stanza a rhyme
somehow eluded him, and he nearly went mad trying to recall it,
while at the same time the other half of his mind went round the
problem of Leece-Lalette, Lalette-Leece, without once making a
real effort toward the plan he must have. Then he tried to solve
how the line of duty might be considered to lie, according to
one or another system of philosophy; but all this yielded was the
unsatisfactory conclusion that he did not know where duty or even
true desire lay, only what he was going to do. Now he began to
count boards in the floor, as he had counted the cask-staves of
the ship, merely to pass time; and time passed. He cracked the door
ajar, heard someone snore, and reached the odd thought that even
the loveliest of girls sometimes snore. Tip, tap, and he was down
the hall to the stairs. A board creaked there; he paused. The key
grated even more harshly than he had anticipated, and again he
stood breathless a minute, then was in the street.</p>
<p>A sense of freedom swelled through him as he looked up at the
winter stars&mdash;this must be the right line, the glorious line, hurrah!
even though the adventure failed. A silent street, down which
advanced in the near distance a cloaked couple, picking their
way along with a light-boy before. The checkered gleams from
the window of his lantern caught the tree-trunks and half-reflected
from the dull surfaces, seemed like weary fireflies. A one-horse
caleche went past, its form dimly outlined against the darker
shadows beneath the branches. Step on, Rodvard, the way is here.
He stumbled in the dark over the edge of a cobble, turned a
corner and another, wondering how the glass stood, and reached
the couvertine Lolau at last.</p>
<p>He remembered it as the building he had passed on his first
day in Charalkis, with a foreyard in which a dead tree stood. The
lodge-box held no porter; its window was broken. Rodvard thought&mdash;now
this is somehow the model of the Myonessae, if I could trace
the resemblance, as his feet clicked on the pave up to the door,
where one light burned behind a transom in a fan of glass. Summing
his force, he knocked. No answer. He knocked again.</p>
<p>Far in the interior a step sounded, coming. The door was
thrown back to show a fat beldame with a robe gathered round
her, whose hand trembled slightly with palsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said. The light was above and behind her,
he could not see her eyes to use his jewel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from the office of account,&rdquo; he said (depending upon
sudden inspiration), &ldquo;in the matter of the Demoiselle Asterhax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor hour to be coming,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;Ay, ay, the
Lalette. I will call the mattern. They will take her in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_376">376</div>
<p>She moved aside to let him enter, and as she did so, the
light caught her face. (His glance, quickened by emergency, caught
in those muddy eyes a green flash of mingled hate and greed.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, and touched her wrist. &ldquo;Perhaps it is not
needed to rouse anyone.&rdquo; (That covetousness&mdash;if he could use it.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a simple matter; not official accounts.&rdquo; He fumbled out a
coin or two and pressed them in her hand.</p>
<p>The fat face moved into a leer. &ldquo;Eh, eh, so that&rsquo;s the story.
Want to take her, do you? And poor Mircella will be blamed,
maybe sent for instruction. It should be worth more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Money again; he experienced a moment of panic.) &ldquo;I am
from the office of account,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I am to take her there
to close her reckoning. You will have the perquisite of her possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, he, and you the best perquisite. It should be worth more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh, someone will hear us.&rdquo; He found another pair of coins.
&ldquo;This is all&mdash;if not, give back the rest and call your mattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned; she clutched his arm, grumbling in her throat (and
he could see she did not believe him in the least, but would be
satisfied if given a story to tell). &ldquo;Come. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another stair-journey through a silent house, this time upward.
The place had the indefinable perfume of many women. The guide
shuffled along in a dark almost complete; Rodvard heard the chink
of keys, then a tick against the lock and the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike a light.&rdquo; Rodvard felt a candle pressed into his hand;
being forced to give his attention to it, Lalette saw him first when
the light flared, he heard her gasp and looked past the little flame
to see her standing with disheveled hair, so lovely beyond the
imagined picture that he could not resist running across the room
to kiss her astonished lips. She must have been sitting fully dressed
in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodvard! How did you come here?&rdquo; The fat woman shuffled
in the background, and he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter now, it can wait. We must go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him like a sleepwalker. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no more words between them at this time or place.
Lalette turned in the feeble light to make a package, but the fat
woman said; &ldquo;Nah, my perquisite,&rdquo; so she only snatched a cloak.
The beldame addressed Rodvard; &ldquo;Now you use your knife on
the lock to show where it was picked, then leave it. Then they
know my story is true, a man was here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_377">377</div>
<p>He hacked at the brass plate that held the keyhole for a
moment, and fortune favored by letting one of the screws come
loose with a snap, and the fat woman clawed his arm to indicate
that was enough. She led the way down the stair, Rodvard could
see no eyes, and he and Lalette were suddenly out the door.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>She turned to face him under the dead tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not want me any more. How did you find me? Where
did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He thought: out of one pattern-dance of compulsions and into
another.) &ldquo;I do want you or I would not have come. I could not
help it. Did you not receive my letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have some story to cover your utter desertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear I left with Dr. Remigorius a letter for you, telling
how I was called to Sedad Vix on the most urgent of affairs; and
then things happened. I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is true. You are one of the Sons of the New Day.&rdquo; (The
eyes were hidden, but the tone told clearly how deep was her
anger and despair.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come for you,&rdquo; he said, simply.</p>
<p>She uttered a bitter little laugh. &ldquo;It is somewhat late, my friend.
I am one of the licensed whores they call Myonessae, and now an
attainted criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;and so am I for bringing you from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took three steps in silence. &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tavern.&rdquo; (He had not thought, this was part of the plan he
had been too excited to make.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you lodge in it?&rdquo; (The voice was so small that he knew
something lay behind the words.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been working in the office of account, and learned of
your trouble there,&rdquo; he said, inconsecutively.</p>
<p>She turned toward him in the dark street, where far down,
someone walked with a light, the hand on his arm trembling a
little. &ldquo;Oh, Rodvard&mdash;they would have put me in that prison for
instruction and then turned me into the street without an obula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. See&mdash;that is what we are looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">378</div>
<p>An inn it was, a palpable inn, beyond the corner, with light
streaming from its windows. They entered through the public-room
where a table of men with mugs before them all turned their heads
like sunflowers. One of them whispered behind a hand, and there
was a snicker. A lugubrious person in a dirty apron came to the
inner door and said yah, he would give them welcome for the night.
Supper? No, said they both, and a small girl with her hair in tight
braids showed them to a room where there was only one chair
and a bed where they would sleep together for the first time since
the night in Dame Domijaiek&rsquo;s room, now in a far country and
long ago. (Rodvard thought: she is wearing her hair down as an
unwedded girl, and that is why they snickered.) She sat on the
edge of the bed, tossing her head back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodvard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have been unfaithful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; (He answered in reaction merely, and the thought that
crossed his mind was not of the maid Damaris, but of Leece, now
perhaps herself sleepless, and waiting for the dawn, when&mdash;) &ldquo;Your
Blue Star is still bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not move, only crossed her eyes in a spasm of pain.
&ldquo;I think perhaps it was another witch. I know one put a spell on
you. Did you know I saved you from it? You can go to her, if you
wish; even take the Blue Star. I do not want it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette! Do not talk so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to her on the bed, slipped his arm under both hers
where she supported herself, leaning backward, and drove her
down, his lips seeking hers. She met him passively, neither giving
nor avoiding. &ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he breathed again.</p>
<p>Now she twisted in his arms. &ldquo;Ah, men think there is only one
way to resolve every problem with a girl. It was that I wished to
get away from. I will go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released her then, and lay beside her, unspeaking for a
moment. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be sent for instruction and then turned out? It was that I
came to save you from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am grateful. I will not go back, then, and you can have
what you have bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(There was a torture in it that he should at this moment think
of Maritzl of Stojenrosek.) He double-jointed to his feet and began
to pace the floor. &ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;truly you do not understand.
We are in real danger, both of us, and cannot afford bitterness. I
have not been in this country long enough to know its laws, but I
know we have broken more than one; and they are very intent after
both of us, you as a witch and me with the Blue Star, even though
they say witchery is not forbidden here. Now I ask your true help,
as I have helped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend, of course. What would you have me do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_379">379</div>
<p>She sat up suddenly, with a tear in the corner of her eye
(which he affected not to notice), all kindliness; and they began
to talk, not of their present emergency, but of their adventures and
how strangely they were met there. He gave her a fair tale on
almost all, except about Damaris and Leece. She interrupted now
and again, as something he said reminded her of one detail or
another, so that neither of them even thought of sleeping until the
candle burning down and a pale window spoke of approaching day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where our line lies now, I do not know,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Inconsequentially, she said; &ldquo;Tell me truly, Rodvard, about the
Sons of the New Day.&rdquo; (Her face was toward him as she spoke;
he was astonished to catch in her eye a complex thought, something
about feeling herself no better than the group she considered
thieves and murderers.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we are not murderers and steal from none,&rdquo; he
said (as she, remembering the power of the jewel, lowered her
head; for she had not told him of the fate of Tegval). &ldquo;We are
only trying to make a better world, where badges of condition are
no more needed than here in Mancherei, and men and women too,
do not obtain their possessions by being born into them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a strange thing to say to one who was born into a
witch-family,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But no matter now. What shall we do? I
doubt if we can reach the inner border before they set the guards
after us, and with the case of this captain against you, you cannot
now return to Dossola. Or can you? We might get a ship that
would take us to the Green Islands. I have a brother there somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to pay the passage? For I have little money. Much of
my gain has been withheld to pay for the things I needed when I
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I no money at all. But did you come here from Dossola
by paying? Can we not offer service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He (thought of the one-eyed captain and the service demanded
then, but) took her hand. &ldquo;You are right, and it is the only thing
to try,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come, before any pursuit fairly starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crept down the stairs, hand in hand, like conspirators.
At the parlor Rodvard sacrificed one of his coins to pay for his
night&rsquo;s lodging. (The thought of Leece and what she would be
doing at this hour was in his mind as) they stepped into a street
from which the grey light had rubbed out all the night&rsquo;s romance
to leave the city drab and wintry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">380</div>
<p>A milk-vendor met them with his goats and gave a swirl of
his pipes in greeting. There were few other passengers abroad, but
more began to appear as they drew near the harbor area; carters
and busy men, and hand-porters. Presently they were among warehouses
and places of commerce. Beyond lay the quays and a tangle
of masts. Here was a tavern, opening for the day; the proprietor
said that a Captain &rsquo;Zenog had a ship at the fourth dock down,
due to sail for the Green Isles with the tide. The place was not hard
to find, nor the captain either, standing by the board of his vessel,
strong and squat, like a giant beaten into lesser stature by the
mallet of one still stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Green Islands captain, aye, I am that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
you there on the smoothest ship that sails the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Rodvard; &ldquo;I do not doubt it. But we have no money and
wish to work our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bluff heartiness fell away from him (and the glance said he
was suspicious of something). &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a clerical, really, but would take other labor merely to
reach the Green Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said; &ldquo;I have done sewing and could mend a sail here
and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain rubbed a chin peppered with beard. &ldquo;A clerical I
could use fair enough, one that could cast accounts.&rdquo; He looked
around. &ldquo;Most of you Amorosians, though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard said joyously; &ldquo;I am not of Mancherei, but Dossolan,
educated there, and can cast up an account as easily&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be no pay in it. The voyage merely,&rdquo; said the man
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do it for that,&rdquo; said Rodvard, and touched Captain
&rsquo;Zenog&rsquo;s hand in acceptance. The squat man turned. &ldquo;Oh&eacute;!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Hinze, take these two to the port office and get them
cleared for a voyage with us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">22</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAW OF LOVE</span></h2>
<p>(For a moment after the man had spoken, Rodvard felt as
though he were falling.) He looked at Lalette (and saw the same
black fear was in her also), but the step was taken, they could only
hope to carry matters through at the port office. Hinze was a thin
man in a sailor&rsquo;s jacket, who looked over his shoulder back at the
captain as he led them down the cobbles to a brick building that
Lalette remembered all too well. &ldquo;You will find it a good voyage.
The ship is tight as an egg, but the food not too good,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">381</div>
<p>There was a doorman in his coop, who directed Hinze down a
hall, whereupon the girl clutched Rodvard&rsquo;s arm and said; &ldquo;I do
not like this. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A silly remark, he thought.) &ldquo;We cannot run away now,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is the only chance&rdquo;; and Hinze was back to say that the
protostylarion would entertain them at once, there could be only
a moment of waiting. They looked at each other apprehensively;
Lalette leaned against a wall and closed her eyes, and a man came
down the hall to call them in.</p>
<p>Rodvard led the way into a room where a little man sat behind
a desk with lines of disobligingness set round his mouth. He said;
&ldquo;You wish to leave the dominion of Mancherei for the barbarous
Green Islands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because of a family matter,&rdquo; said Rodvard. &ldquo;My wife and
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The protostylarion looked at Lalette&rsquo;s hair, down in the maiden-sweep,
then quickly at Rodvard and back to her face. Wrinkles
shot up the middle of his forehead. &ldquo;Wife? Wife? What is your
profession? Where is your certificate of employ?&rdquo; He came up out
of his seat (like a small bear, Rodvard thought), peering the more
intently at the girl. &ldquo;Ah, I have it! I know! You are the one I
registered for the Myonessae. The Dossolan; and a witch, too.
Guards! Guards!&rdquo; His voice went treble; two or three armed men
tumbled into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inquiry!&rdquo; said the protostylarion, flinging up his arm to
point at the couple as Hinze shrank back. &ldquo;These two for an inquiry!
I accuse her of being a runaway Myonessan!&rdquo; The face was distorted
(the thought behind it one of the purest delight and triumph).
&ldquo;Be careful with her; she is a witch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard was gripped above the elbow and jerked stumbling to
the door, catching only a glimpse of Lalette&rsquo;s despairing face. Outside,
people stopped and goggled as the two were hurried along
and into a carriage, with a guard beside each. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; began
Rodvard, but one of the guards said; &ldquo;Close your clack; no talking
among prisoners.&rdquo; (His eyes spoke a brutality that would have
taken pleasure in a blow.)</p>
<p>They came to a structure with a battlemented gate, like a small
fortress; an odor of sewage emanated from it. A pair of guards
brought forward bills in salutation to those entering. Rodvard and
Lalette were swung into a gate-house, where a man lounged at a
window&mdash;an officer by his shoulder-knot. One of the guards said;
&ldquo;These two are in for an inquiry. Authority of the Protostylarion
Barthv&ouml;di. He says to be careful of the woman, she&rsquo;s a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_382">382</div>
<p>The officer looked at Lalette appreciatively, then seated himself
at the desk and drew out a paper. &ldquo;Your names and professions,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Rodvard gave his; Lalette checked over the profession (wishing
to cry out that she would not give it, wishing to defy the man).
The officer looked at her. &ldquo;You are warned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am
diaconal, and your witchery will be wasted on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, and half-choking; &ldquo;Myonessan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which couvertine? . . . The more trouble it is to obtain the
information, the harder it will be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer turned to one of the guards. &ldquo;Go to the couvertine
of Lolau and inform the mattern that she is to come here tomorrow
morning at the fourth glass for an inquiry in the matter of Demoiselle
Lalette.&rdquo; He addressed the other guard. &ldquo;You wait here while
I draw the proclamation calling for information on this Bergelin,
then take it around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Rodvard thought of Leece, and wondered what she would
say in answer to the proclamation), (Lalette of facing Dame
Quasso again.) Another pair of guards came in to take them to
stone cells, set in the wall of the fortress. Rodvard saw Lalette
vanish into one and heard the door clang behind her, then was
himself thrust into another. There was a stool and straw on the
floor, an archery-slit for the only lighting. The place stank, the
origin of which odor was a bucket beneath the archery-slit. He
sat on the stool and tried to think, but the turmoil of fear held
him so that he could do little more than run around back and
over his own conduct like a mouse, to ask where he had stepped
wrongly and what else he could have done to make things come out
other than they were. This was the morning when Leece . . . and
he would have been bound to her for life. . . . No, that could
not have been the right path. Farther back, then? When he asked
that, he went off into a train of reminiscence in which thought
almost ceased.</p>
<p>His throat was dry, there was no water in the cell. Nor did
he seem to have near neighbors, all being silence around, save
that somewhere a tiny drip of water increased his thirst. Would
he be able to hold anything back tomorrow morning at the inquiry,
where an Initiate would surely question? Round the circuit
of his failure his mind ran again, and slid off into a consideration
of present circumstance. He rose, going to the iron-bound door,
but even the small trap in it would not open from his side. Alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">383</div>
<p>Not for the first time. How like the imprisonment on the ship
this was, and how dark the prospect had loomed then! Out of
that he had risen, but to what? A choice between Leece and this.
A wave of misery swept across him, and then he thought of
Lalette, and her misery equal to his own, and maybe more.</p>
<p>But this was no help either, and he began to examine his
prison, finger-breadth by finger-breadth, for something that might
take his mind away from this procession of regrets and anxieties
toward a future he could not know. There were only accidents of
the wall at first, in which he tried to see pictures and carvings,
making up a tale for himself, like those in the ballads. This had
not gone far when he came to a trace of writing which looked as
though someone had tried to wipe it out, for there were only a
few words to be read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horv . . . in the month . . . only for lov . . . God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cryptic message, indeed; he tried to imagine the tale behind
it, and how the love of which these Amorosians forever gabbled
had brought someone to this cell. This caused him to ask himself
whether it was really love for Lalette that had brought him there;
for that matter whether he loved her, and what love was; and to
none of these questions could he find a satisfactory answer, because
he kept comparing her with Maritzl and wondering whether
the emotion were the same. But this in turn brought a deep weariness;
he flung himself on the straw to rest and work the matter
out; and so doing, fell into an uneasy slumber&mdash;product of his
sleepless night&mdash;in which he dreamed that the world was ruled,
not by the God he had been taught to believe in, nor disputed by
the two gods of whom the Amorosians spoke, but by three demons,
who sat in a closed space with smoke pouring from their mouths,
and decided what penalties should be exacted for witchery.</p>
<p>A key grated; he woke to see the trap being pulled back
from without, and a voice said roughly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your banquet, my lord. The sweetmeats come with
the dancing girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A plate was thrust through, with a pewter mug of water. On
the former were some vegetables, cold and sticky, and no table
utensils, but Rodvard was in a mood of hunger that forbade him
to be over-nice and he ate, saving part of his water to cleanse his
fingers after the meal. It was hardly done before the trap opened
again, and the outer voice demanded; &ldquo;The tools, pig-face. The
administration doesn&rsquo;t give souvenirs to its guests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_384">384</div>
<p>Rodvard passed the dishes through and seated himself again.
Time ticked; the light that had been fading when he woke was
all gone, he had slept so much that he could do so no more and
the uncertainty of his lot held him from consecutive thought.
Somewhere outside there was a thin cry and a sound of feet. Then
quiet again, but for the briefest space; and now another key
grated, in the main lock of his door. It was flung open; in the
space stood a small man and a dark, with no cap. Behind him, a
smoky torch held by another showed this first visitor to be holding
a naked sword, that dripped, plash, plash, on the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Bergelin?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I call myself Demad&eacute; Slair.
The revolt has begun. Have you the Blue Star safe?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Questions whirled in Rodvard&rsquo;s mind, but the larger of the
pair said; &ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; and gripped him by the elbow like the guard
who had brought him in, dragging along the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Rodvard, resisting. &ldquo;There is another&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry,&rdquo; said Demad&eacute; Slair. &ldquo;You do not know how
desperate a business this is. We have had to kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I will not leave her. She is my sweetheart; my witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have her here? Of the two of you, she is the more important!
Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the third cell here, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word Slair counted off. &ldquo;The torch, Cordisso,&rdquo;
and began to try keys from a chain of them. The big man advanced
the torch, but the place held only some babbling, furtive creature
with white hair and idiot eyes. The next cell was empty. Slair
swore furiously. &ldquo;You are sure your doxy&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was brought in with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried another door. It was she, rising surprised from the
floor in a whirl of dresses. Rodvard pushed past the small man to
grip her by the hands. &ldquo;Come, and quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made small uncomprehending sounds. Rodvard put an
arm around her and drew her toward the door. Reverse of the
stair by which they had been brought in; in the torchlight Rodvard
saw a pair of feet at the base. A dead man, one of the
guards. In spite of the hurry, he paused to unbelt the fellow&rsquo;s
dag, and rushed with the rest, feeling more a man again now
the lost knife was replaced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_385">385</div>
<p>At the outer gate stood two more men, hoods pulled over
their faces. They saluted Demad&eacute; respectively and led across the
street to where a carriage stood, pushing Lalette into the back
seat. There were three horses, one in front of the pair, according
to the Mancherei fashion. One of the hooded men cracked his
whip, and they were off at a bumping pace, as Demad&eacute; Slair
said; &ldquo;It is as well you were placed in arrest and proclaimed this
afternoon. We should not have known how to find you otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you&mdash;Dr. Remigorius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow winked across the man&rsquo;s face, even in the dark.
&ldquo;The High Center; I say the revolt has begun and they are in
rule. But you shall be told everything soon.&rdquo; He would say no
more; the carriage bumped across cobbles, and they were at the
dock, with a man holding a candle-lantern by its side. Slair
leaped down without offering a hand to Lalette and sprang across
the plank of a ship with &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; Already, as she and Rodvard
reached the deck a whistle was blown, and men were moving
rapidly among the ropes. They followed their guide&rsquo;s beckoning
down a ladder to a cabin; he set the lantern on a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let yourselves be placed, and hear me carefully,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is of the utmost moment to the cause and everything that
you are not caught or even held back. If the guards come aboard,
if we are stopped by a galley as we leave the harbor, you are
strictly to go down the ladder leftward of this cabin. At its base
is a pile of bales of goods, of which one is hollowed out to take a
man, with a flap at the edge that can be pulled to from inside.
Insert yourself and pull the flap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A thrill more of excitement than apprehension shot through
Rodvard; the thought of being as important as this to the great
enterprise.) He said; &ldquo;If this ship&rsquo;s invaded, they will likely have
an Initiate or at least one of their diaconals with them, and from
the mind of anyone aboard, he will be likely to know where the
hiding place is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair grinned. &ldquo;That has been thought of. No one knows of this
hollow but me. I made it and can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said; &ldquo;And I; what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair frowned. &ldquo;You are a problem, demoiselle. We came for
friend Rodvard and his Blue Star, imagining you were still in
Dossola, and there&rsquo;s no preparation.&rdquo; He put an index-finger on
his chin. &ldquo;You have the Art. Could you not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised a hand. &ldquo;Ah, no. Never.&rdquo; (In the flash of her eye
Rodvard saw how she was thinking of some witchery on a ship,
something terrible and sickening connected with it.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Slair. &ldquo;Against an Initiate, it would miss nine
times out of ten. And concealment&rsquo;s a weak resource. No, the
problem is one of hiding you in plain sight; that is, to let them
look but not know your identity. . . . Ah, I have it; let your hair
down and the hem of your dress up to show an ankle; be one of
those travelling strumpets who call themselves sea-witches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said steadily; &ldquo;How will this deceive one of the Initiates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Demad&eacute; Slair made a twisting with his mouth. &ldquo;Why, demoiselle,
these Initiates are not magicians; they can read no more
than thoughts and not all of those. All women have in them a
trifle of the strumpet; you have but to think yourself one, be one
with your mind. It would be a rare Initiate to tell the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Lalette&rsquo;s mind beat frantic wings; the bars were there again,
whatever route she took led to the same cage); (and Rodvard
caught enough of her thought to know how deep was her trouble.)
&ldquo;Is there not some better plan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time; see, the ship is stirring.&rdquo; Demad&eacute; Slair stood up. &ldquo;So
now I must leave you.&rdquo; The door banged behind him.</p>
<p>Lalette said; &ldquo;This is a second rescue&mdash;from one prison to another,
each time. I thank you, Rodvard.&rdquo; (Her eyes flashed a dark
color of anger, he knew what was stirring in her mind, but also
that if he mentioned it directly, there would be a flash.)</p>
<p>He said; &ldquo;Lalette, let me implore you. I will not quarrel with
you about whose making this trouble is, or how we seem to go
from one difficulty to another. But if we can work together, this
escape shall be better than the last. I did not leave you at the
couvertine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am grateful,&rdquo; she said, in the tone of one who is not
grateful in the least, turning aside her head. &ldquo;If you had only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He had wit enough not to carry this line on.) &ldquo;Do you know
anything of this revolt?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She turned again. &ldquo;Ah, I cannot bear if that I should never have
a thought of my own while I am with you. Will you give me back
the Blue Star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It is all our lives and fortune now, and the fate of many
more important than we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not beautiful and brilliant like those girls of noble
houses; but even so, would like to be wanted for myself, and not
what I can bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the first harbor-swell caught the ship; she turned her
face again, queasy at her stomach. They slept in shut-beds on
opposite sides of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">23</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NETZNEGON: RETURN TO GLORY</span></h2>
<p>The skies were filled with glory, the new day rising. The man
who called himself Demad&eacute; Slair explained, leaning against the
rail at the waist of the ship, in the blue-and-gold morning, a day
anointed with white in the form of a circling seagull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an intricate tale,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of which the sum is that we are
unlikely to see queens in Netznegon again. But I&rsquo;ll begin with
Cleudi&rsquo;s plan for having the nobles gather taxes in their seignories.
They would not have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that seemed to be happening when I was at
the conference of court,&rdquo; said Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say there was a scene to remember when Florestan told
the old bitch there was no more money,&rdquo; Slair went on with a
laugh. &ldquo;She beat him about the head with a slipper and for days
he wore a patch over one eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said; &ldquo;She is your queen.&rdquo; (She wanted to cry out, to
say something that would drive this man to fury.)</p>
<p>Rodvard drew her hand toward him, but she pulled it away;
Demad&eacute; Slair said; &ldquo;I crave your pardon, demoiselle; truly. I did
not know you were so royalist. . . . Then Brunivar fell. You heard
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard said; &ldquo;I have had little news, buried in Charalkis;
only that there were troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attainted of treasons, and sent to the throat-cutter. The case
was pressed by the Duke of Aggermans, very violent against him,
no one altogether knows why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could find a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, with your stone. But d&rsquo;you see the situation that
left? With Brunivar gone, there&rsquo;s no regent-apparent in the case
of Her Majesty&rsquo;s death, which may fall any day. I think it was
you who sent word to the Center that Florestan expected the
regency in his room. Very like he would have had it, too, but for
the tax matter; but the regency question furnishing an excuse the
nobles summoned a general assembly of all the estates, and once
they were met, they began to consider everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the revolt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_388">388</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it began in the west&mdash;at Veierelden, with some of the
army and not with our party at all. Brunivar&rsquo;s people joined, setting
forward the name of Prince Pavinius, and how he was wrongfully
set aside from the succession, and had long since abandoned
being an Amorosian. They even persuaded the old man to come
out of Mayern and raise his standard. Most of the nobles have
gone there with what troops there are, but I don&rsquo;t know how much
fighting there has been. Neither side&rsquo;s very anxious for war. The
important thing is that the great assembly was left in session with
the nobles out of it, and you can see what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. Enlighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why our party in the majority and Mathurin in control of
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard turned a face of utter astonishment. &ldquo;Mathurin?
How&mdash;What&mdash;? I might have thought Dr. Remigorius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair laughed again, a sharp bark. &ldquo;Bergelin, for one who can
see the thoughts in a head, you are the ignorantest man I have
seen&mdash;or one of the cleverest.&rdquo; He shot a quick glance of suspicion
at Rodvard. &ldquo;You truly did not know that Mathurin was the head
of the High Center, the major leader of the Sons? As for Remigorius,
the less you mention him, the better. Some connections
are not quite healthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; said Rodvard slowly (trying in his mind to
re-assort the tumbled building-blocks of his world). &ldquo;But I? The
Blue Star&rsquo;s a treasure, but why send a ship for such a mouse as
I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer your own question, friend Bergelin. Look, here&rsquo;s
Pavinius; the court; our party with its control of the great assembly;
maybe some of Tritulaccan tendency, and a few Amorosians&mdash;all
opposed to each other. You are the only man we know can
untangle where the true loyalties lie and discover whom we can
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, this is not the only Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one we can be sure of. We know the court butler
Tuol&eacute;n had one; perhaps there is one or more in Pavinius&rsquo; party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say &lsquo;had.&rsquo; Does Tuol&eacute;n have it no longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair looked sidewise (with something a little savage in his
glance). &ldquo;An accident befell him. You know Mathurin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Lalette; &ldquo;If I understand what you mean, you had him
killed. But this would not affect the Blue Star itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we could find the heiress. And there&rsquo;s another question
also; suppose we have found her, does she know enough of the
Art to make the Star active? True witches are very hard to find,
with the episcopals so bitter against the Art on the one hand, and
the Amorosians draining so many off to Mancherei on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_389">389</div>
<p>&ldquo;My mother&mdash;&rdquo; began Lalette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mathurin followed that line up long ago. She could
instruct, but would she? I think not for our party; the last I heard
she had followed Cleudi and the court out to Zenss. You two are
our mainstay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard (thinking of the witch of Kazmerga, and thinking
also that it would be little good for the Sons of the New Day to
have commerce with her) said; &ldquo;It should not be hard to trace
Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s heiress. I was in the Office of Pedigree myself once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more reason why you&rsquo;re a figure. I&rsquo;ll conceal nothing;
most of those who can read the old hands, or trace the pedigrees,
are either fled with the court or little trusty. We dare not
place reliance in them; and it&rsquo;s a matter of hurry with the armies
in the west both anxious to do us harms, and even the Tritulaccans
calling out new troops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whistle blew; men moved among the ropes, the ship changed
slant. Rodvard said; &ldquo;What you say is very strange. I would like
to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, enough of politics for now. I must make my apologies to
this lovely demoiselle for having spoken unthinkingly.&rdquo; He offered
his arm to Lalette. &ldquo;Will you honor me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard was left standing; and not for the only time either,
in the next three or four days, for Lalette formed the habit of
walking with Slair along the deck, she laughing and both of them
talking of trifles in a manner that seemed to Rodvard inane and
pointless. Of an evening the girl would hardly speak at all, or
if she did so, it was in a flat voice, shunning his eyes, so that he
could tell little of what she was thinking; at night, she shut herself
in her lock-bed before undressing. This became so intolerable that
at last he rose one night and tapped on the door of her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open,&rdquo; he said, and over the noise of the thuttering rigging,
heard her say faintly, &ldquo;Rodvard, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, I say,&rdquo; he cried again. &ldquo;You must hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence of seven breaths, and then he heard her
spin the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why do you treat me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I treated you worse than you have treated me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He fought back an impulse to a retort that would bring
angers.) &ldquo;I do not know that I follow all you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_390">390</div>
<p>(There was only night-shine from the window, she emboldened
at knowing he could not learn her fullest thought.) &ldquo;Will you
still say you did not cheat me? Now that I know you were always
one of the Sons of the New Day. Tuol&eacute;n had an accident&mdash;and
the doorman at your house&mdash;and how many more? I used to believe
in some things before you trapped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trap,&rdquo; said he, jerking back so violently he struck a beam
and gave an exclamation. &ldquo;No trap. You cannot make a new world
without destroying some of the old, and some suffer unjustly for
every gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a small voice she said; &ldquo;I feel&mdash;used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he said gravely, and not taking offense. &ldquo;Listen to
me. We of the Sons of the New Day are truly striving for a better
world, one in which there are such things as honesty and justice
for everyone. But this much I have learned, and not from Dr.
Remigorius, that any such effort is a swimming against the world&rsquo;s
stream, and must be paid for. You feel used? Myself no less. But
I like to think of myself as used for the betterment of men&mdash;perhaps
by God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was a little unsteady at the end, and now it was
her turn to be silent for a moment. At last she said; &ldquo;And how
do you know the use is for betterment&mdash;not someone&rsquo;s personal
pleasure in ordering others? What you say is not too different from
the teaching I heard at the couvertine. Only there they would say
that God uses no earthly vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I do not know. I only know that I am tired, and alone,
alone . . .&rdquo; The words tailed off, he heard her shift in the darkness
of the bed, and then the intake of a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette, don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo; He bent over, wiping a tear from her
face, then as it was followed by more, fell to kissing her eyes. &ldquo;I
love you&rdquo; (for the first time since that night on the roofs).
&ldquo;Lalette, Lalette.&rdquo; More and more he kissed, from eyes to lips,
and she gripped her arms around him (because he was the nearest
anchor in a shifting world), and his kissing turned to passion
(as she had known it would, and what did it matter?) (But she
was only a recipient, and to Rodvard it was a relief and an agony.
In that moment he wished it had been Leece.)</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was after sunset bell when they came upstream to Netznegon
city, its gated towers rising dark against the west like the worn
teeth of giants. Rodvard stood near the prow, hearing the measured
cry of seamen at the sweeps; through all he felt the golden
note of glory returning. Dossola (he murmured to himself)&mdash;Dossola
strong and fair, how shall I contribute to your greatness
and so find my own? He felt himself making a poem of it, but
in a rush of emotion so intense that he could not bring the rhymes
quite true, nor the rhythm neither, quite; and when he tried to
pause and think consciously of how the verses should go, the
emotion vanished, and the dark city was only a tumbled pile of
stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>The bridge leading to the southern suburbs blotted out the
prospect; little white cakes of ice came swimming like ducks
down the stream, and the ship swung to its quay, the one around
the curve. There were lanterns there and a little group waiting;
they must have been seen from the walls, and the word passed
through to meet them. Someone hallooed to Rodvard from the
stern of the ship; Demad&eacute; Slair was waiting there with Lalette,
muffled close in her long cloak. (Rodvard thought: we are come
back to Dossola, both of us, as naked as when we left it, but at
least with more hope.) Said Slair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be as well to hurry. It does not do to be on the
streets too much at night these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The back of Rodvard&rsquo;s mind recognized that he had given
Lalette no more than a priest&rsquo;s argument that night in the lock-bed,
and wished that he had found a better, since she must see
the defect in this one. But what? How educate her to the ideal?)
The plank was flung. Five or six men were at the other end, one
of them in a provost&rsquo;s cloak, but the shoes were not like what
they should be, nor did the doublet seem to belong to the uniform.
A longsword bulged out the cloak; the eyes flicked past Rodvard
to rest on Lalette. Demad&eacute; Slair identified himself and shepherded
his charges past a dark shed to the quay-side street. A
man was there with a horse; Slair spoke to him, he swung himself
into the saddle and rode off.</p>
<p>Said Rodvard (to say something); &ldquo;That provost seemed in an
inquiring mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair; &ldquo;This was no provost. The general assembly has abolished
that hateful order. What you saw was a people&rsquo;s guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard; &ldquo;This is a different Dossola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair; &ldquo;It will be a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said; &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the guest-house of the nation, that used to be the palace
of Baron Ulutz, who has fled to join Pavinius. The man has gone
for a carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_392">392</div>
<p>The conversation winked out. Around a corner of the street
somewhere in the dim, there was a shout that came to them only
as the confused &ldquo;Yaya!&rdquo; of many throats, followed by a crash of
glass and then another shout. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Rodvard looked at
Slair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the people, doubtless. You should know; there are
many debts being paid these days.&rdquo; He shrugged.</p>
<p>Lalette stirred; (without the Blue Star&rsquo;s intervention Rodvard
knew that she would find in this wild lawlessness the case against
his new day). He said; &ldquo;Is there much of this from day to day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s voice was indifferent. &ldquo;Enough. It is mostly Zigraner
moneylenders who suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Round the corner came a carriage with a single horse, the
messenger riding ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will report to the office of the committee at the second
glass in the morning,&rdquo; said Slair to the rider. The fellow&rsquo;s chin was
badly shaven; he leaned from the saddle and said; &ldquo;Well, friend
Slair, I will do the best I can, but it will be hard to ride more
messages so early, for Mousey here is nearly done, and she&rsquo;s my
livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard now noticed that the horse was drooping with weariness,
but Demad&eacute; Slair said; &ldquo;If you lose one, there&rsquo;s another. The
people&rsquo;s business will not wait. Be on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man got slowly down and patted the neck of the horse.
&ldquo;Friend Slair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am as much for the people as anyone,
but there&rsquo;s more to this than livelihood. This is my friend.&rdquo; The
tired horse sniffed at the hand he put up.</p>
<p>Slair surprisingly burst into laughter. &ldquo;Go, then, with your
friend. I&rsquo;ll be your warranty if you are late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage had wide seats; Lalette huddled down in the
corner, so that Rodvard was barely touching the edge of her
cloak, and Slair sat facing them. Beyond the corner, where the
turbulence was, figures were visible at a little distance and torches
moving, but nobody said anything in the vehicle (because, thought
Rodvard, there was so much to say).</p>
<p>Presently they turned in at the gate of the wide-flung Ulutz
palace, where some statue on the entrance-pillar had been thrown
down, leaving broken stone across the cobbles. There were lights
in the building, but no doorman. Demad&eacute; Slair led the way, and
straight up the wide flight of marble steps to a tall-walled room,
where he struck light to a candle. A huge bed stood in the corner,
and one of the chairs had been slit, so that the material of the
upholstery flowed upon the carpet. &ldquo;I bid you good-night,&rdquo; said
their guide. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kitchen below-stairs where you can have
breakfast, and a messenger will call for you in the morning, friend
Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_393">393</div>
<p>When they were alone, Lalette sat in the good chair with
her hands in her lap, and looked at her feet. &ldquo;Rodvard,&rdquo; she said
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; (His heart jumped hopefully.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful. You are not so important to them as you think.
If you were&mdash;gone, they might make me give the Blue Star to
someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could they compel you to put the witchery on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But they might find another witch . . . Rodvard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went over to her, but at his touch she made a small gesture
of dismissal, as though to rebuke him for bringing something childish
into a moment of utter intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, Rodvard. Don&rsquo;t let them do that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped away from her. &ldquo;Ah, pest, you are shying at
shadows. I am a member of the Sons; and even so you have the
Art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only undressed to a shift, and wrapped it close around
her, sleeping on the far side of the bed. The water was very cold.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">24</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SPEECHES IN THE GREAT ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<p>It was the old Hall of Presence. The throne stood as before,
its dark wood bright with jewels, and the jewelled star bright
above it, so that Rodvard felt at his back almost a palpable emanation
of Dossola&rsquo;s high fame. Before him, chairs had been swung
out from the walls into the space where all had once stood to
hear judgments pronounced from the throne, as in the great days
of King Crotinianus; and other chairs brought in, not consonant
with those already there. He himself occupied the seat once reserved
to the Announcer, two steps up; a board was placed for
him to write on, since this was to be the pretence for his being
there. To the right, another step up, was the place once occupied
by the Chamberlain, which Mathurin would presently take. It
also had a board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_394">394</div>
<p>Rodvard looked out across the hall, now filling with men,
most of whom bowed to the throne on entering, in the ancient
form. Very few were badged with coronets, and it seemed to
Rodvard a cause of hope and pleasure that this was so. There
was a solid group of legists; some merchants; and a few men from
the lesser orders, though not as many as he had expected. As he
watched, the Episcopals came in, six of the seven at once, not
looking around at the fall and sudden rise of chatter that attended
their entrance. They moved to places in the premier row of
chairs; legist badges began drifting toward them as straws on a
stream will be drawn by a log.</p>
<p>Mathurin came in. He wore his servant&rsquo;s black and badge of
low condition as though they were robes and a crown, strutting
visibly. He did not bow to the throne, but walked straight up to
the Chamberlain&rsquo;s place, sat down, bounced up again immediately
and slapped his palm on the board for attention. As the buzz of
talk died reluctantly and men took their places, he watched with
tight lips; when only two or three whisperers remained, he struck
the board again and said; &ldquo;There is a new matter of utmost importance
before the assembly of the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A solid-looking man who bore the coronet badge stood up
into the dramatic pause and said; &ldquo;I am the Marquis of Palm.
There is an old matter for which this assembly was called that I
shall never cease to urge. No regent-apparent has been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was allowed to say no more. A chorus of angry babblings
covered his voice, and Mathurin slapped sharply. His voice rose;
&ldquo;I am only the writer before this assembly, and will place before
it whatever is desired; but it does not seem to me that it wishes
to hear your proposal, Ser Marquis. The more since the matter of
which I speak is so great that it overrides every other. I have to
say that the nation, already threatened by exterior enemies, is
now called upon to face a worse danger, one that will call for all
our exertions. It is this: the leaders in whom we have most trusted
have turned traitor, and are conspiring with the enemies of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there were more babblings, and angry cries, such as &ldquo;Cut
their throats!&rdquo; with a couple of fists brandished aloft; but Rodvard
noticed that all the outcry came from one section of the
hall, behind the Episcopals. One of the latter began fanning himself
rapidly. Instead of quieting, the tumult augmented as Mathurin
stood sweeping his eyes across it with a half-triumphant air.
At last he raised a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you the worst,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not in fine words but
brutally, for this is a brutal thing.&rdquo; He shuffled a handfull of
papers. &ldquo;No, wait, I will begin with the tale of how this knowledge
reached us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_395">395</div>
<p>&ldquo;At Drog, below the pass that leads through the Ragged Mountains
to Rushaca, there is an inn. Some eight days gone there
came to it a carriage, bearing one of the ladies of the court, oh, a
beautiful lady, all dressed as though for a ball. She came from
the north, from Zenss, where the court is, and as the road leads
to Tritulacca ultimately, her actions roused some suspicion in the
mind of the innkeeper. He is a true patriot, and thought she
might be carrying wealth away out of the country in violation of
the decree against it; watched her, and noticed that she was very
careful of a certain casket. The innkeeper thereupon summoned
people&rsquo;s guards, who seized the casket and broke it open. They
found no money, but they found&mdash;this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin drew from his papers one that seemed to be of
parchment, and waved it aloft, so that all could see that it bore
at its foot a huge blue seal, star-shaped, the sign-manual of the
chancery of the realm. There were sharp intakes of breath and
stirring among the chairs; the Episcopal who had been fanning
himself stopped. The sturdy man who had described himself as
the Marquis of Palm stared aloft with his mouth open and a
frown on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I read it to you? No, not word for word, for it is written
in Tritulaccan, and with the stupid, decorative court phrases that
try to hide real meaning.&rdquo; (Rodvard thought: he has more orator&rsquo;s
tricks than I ever would have imagined.)</p>
<p>Pause. &ldquo;Here it is, then: a missive, signed with the name of
Count Cleudi, himself a Tritulaccan by birth, to Perisso, Lord
Regent of Tritulacca, but bearing as proof of genuineness, the seal
of our Gracious Majesty, the Queen. The substance of it is that
while without doubt the rebellion of her cousin Pavinius, aided
though he is by the Mayerns, will soon be put down, the war is
likely to be long and wasteful. Her gracious majesty therefore
consents to the proposal of the Lord Perisso, made in the name
of true religion and the old friendship between the two houses,
that he shall join the army of Dossola with not less than sixteen
shars; and in return for this, it is graciously conceded that Tritulacca
has a just claim to the city and province of Sedad Mir. And
some of these Tritulaccan shars shall pass to the war by way of
Netznegon city, to suppress certain disorders there. The rats! There
is no dealing with such people!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_396">396</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; shouted someone almost before he had finished, and
now all over the hall men were on their feet and shouting, but
among other cries there was one of &ldquo;Forgery!&rdquo; Mathurin seemed
to be waiting for that moment. &ldquo;Forgery!&rdquo; he cried, his voice going
up almost to the cracking-point. &ldquo;If you think it is forgery, look at
it yourself,&rdquo; and threw the paper outward, as one might the caught
hunted animal to the dogs. &ldquo;Will you call it forgery when I tell
you also that the whole Tritulaccan fleet has been placed on war
standard? The nation is betrayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the tumult seemed completely out of hand, men moving
from place to place confusedly or trying to say something (and
in every eye Rodvard could catch there was nothing but mere
fury, which expressed itself in a color of maroon). Mathurin
looked out on the scene, making no effort at control; but from the
first row there rose a tall old man with white hair and a face set
in a habitual expression of benevolence, who raised high his
white staff of office, by which Rodvard recognized him as the
Arch-Episcopal, Teurapis Groadon.</p>
<p>Eyes caught the staff; voice after voice was abstracted from
the uproar until only a few still tried to speak, then two, then
none. The Arch-Episcopal waited until there was a silence broken
only by a cough; Mathurin pressed Rodvard&rsquo;s shoulder to read the
eyes, but the old man only cast one swift glance at the dais before
turning to address the assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ser writer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you, lords and estates of the realm,
this is not a pleasant thing that we have heard. There may be
some question of the authenticity of this message, or it may have
been written merely to deceive; a document from the hand of the
heretic Pavinius, who would make himself the equal of God. Yet
I will not deny that we must behave as though it were true; for
if we do nothing, and it proves to be so, it will be too late. And
for myself I fear it is true; for it is given to the spiritual estate to
discern the machinations of the powers of evil. There is before us,
then the question of how, joying in the protection of God, we can
circumvent the machinations of the Enemy, who has made man
and women naturally good, into instruments of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us therefore prayerfully address ourselves to the question
of how the realm may escape this trouble. In an emergency equal
to this, in the reign of King Cloar with Queen Berdette the First,
the assembly of the realm set aside their rule in favor of their
daughter, with her husband, the great King Crontinianus, of glorious
memory. But now there are no heirs female, and of heirs male,
only Prince Pavinius. Thus we seem faced with the hard choice of
accepting him, and so selling the soul to preserve the body, or of
adhering to the Queen&rsquo;s will and saving the soul through bodily
submission to Tritulacca. But I do not think God demands of us
such submission, for our God is a God of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_397">397</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are here met in the high assembly of the realm, which I
hold to represent what of the power material has failed to protect
its own; and the power spiritual is fully represented. Therefore,
though such a step has no basis in law or custom, I say let us set
up a regency in the time of a living Queen. It should have members
of lords and estates to show forth the source of its authority;
and since the true enemy is that power of evil which has led our
good Queen astray, I humbly offer to preside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat. There was a rumor, almost of agreement, but with a
little edge in it that left Rodvard glad the Arch-Episcopal had
ended so, for all the rest of what he said might have led them
to agree, and it seemed to Rodvard that a regency with lords
and Episcopals on it would be only the old rule again. Mathurin
jerked his finger toward one of the brown legists, who had risen
and was waiting for attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the kronzlar Escholl,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I will say that this
proposal of a regency in the time of a living ruler has good support
in law and custom, though it is not generally known. It is
now over eight quadrials of years since King Belodon the Second
was killed at Bregatz during the Zigraner wars, and few remember
that only three weeks before his death, it was determined
that he had gone mad, and the barons set up a council of regency.
We may, I think, assume a like madness in the Queen&rsquo;s
Majesty, since her offer to Perisso is clearly contrary both to the
law of the realm and true religion. His claim to Sedad Mir is
based on descent in the male line, since it is well known that the
last Count of that seignory wrongfully dispossessed his sister,
who survived him to pass on her rights to the crown of Dossola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright morning light struck through the window, fairly
on the speaker&rsquo;s face (and as he took his place, Rodvard caught
from his eye a quick gleam of greed and lust for power, altogether
surprising in one who had spoken so dry and calmly). He
touched Mathurin&rsquo;s arm to mention this, but now half a dozen
more were on their feet to speak, and the writer before the assembly
shot his finger at a man with a merchant&rsquo;s badge, in the
group that had made the tumult when the Marquis of Palm was
shouted down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_398">398</div>
<p>&ldquo;I protest!&rdquo; this one bawled. &ldquo;I am called Brosen Zelitza. We
are the assembly of the nation, and therefore already regents in
our own right. Why vest the regency in a council? Why should
Episcopals have the temporal power as well as the spiritual? If
no one else dares to speak, I will tell you why; it is because they
are sold&mdash;sold to Tritulacca. They wish to have the power to
complete Cleudi&rsquo;s contract, and their objection to it is only a
sham.&rdquo; (The voice had a curious dynamic quality that seemed to
stir the very bones, but in Rodvard&rsquo;s mind, watching the face,
there grew only a picture of something with teeth, he could not
make out any mind or thought.) &ldquo;&mdash;by the rule of these Episcopals
and their mercenaries of the priesthood the old customs of
Dossola were set aside, and it is forbidden that women shall use
the Art. So Dossola is being made a half-nation like the savage
Kjermanash, with women in bondage, unable to defend&mdash;&rdquo; (The
voice was stirring them, excitement in the hall, with movements
and the scratch of a pushed-back chair.) &ldquo;&mdash;corrupt priesthood,
refuge of scoundrels and bastards,&rdquo; (Rodvard swept the line of
the Episcopals, and though they were turned so he could catch
no eyes, every pose told of rising indignation.) &ldquo;&mdash;who cannot define
the God they profess to serve&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The Arch-Episcopal was on his feet again, staff upraised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the sword bites, does it? Conspirator! Plot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The voice that was accustomed to dominating the
vast recesses of the cathedral was thunderous.</p>
<p>Up leaped Mathurin. &ldquo;My lord Episcopal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is
the great assembly of the people, where each may speak in turn.
When you have heard him, we will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arch-Episcopal swung round (and from his eyes Rodvard
could catch the flash of anger clearly enough, but that was not the
sole emotion, and the rest was veiled). &ldquo;I will never hear blasphemy,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;As the highest officer of government remaining
loyal to the realm, I declare this assembly dissolved. All who love
God and Dossola, follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid a renewed outburst, catcalls and shouts of approval
mingled, he lifted his staff high and strode toward the door, followed
by the others of his class. A good half the legists came
behind. The nobles stood, but hung hesitant, looking toward the
strong Marquis of Palm; and then, seeing him sit, some returned
to their seats. Of the merchants some followed, but the little knot
where the shouting started remained in their seats.</p>
<p>When the procession had passed, Mathurin said; &ldquo;The session
for this day is closed.&rdquo; He turned toward Rodvard (and the latter
saw in the smiling eyes that everything had gone exactly according
to plan, and Zelitza was a good man).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_399">399</div>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Rodvard left the Hall of Presence alone, more than a little
prideful at being a partaker in great deeds at last, and wondering
what the old companions at the Office of Pedigree would say,
who had so looked down on and baited him, when they knew
he was one of the writers before the great assembly of the nation.
Silver spadas were in his pouch; the new clothes were neat; it
was the finest day of winter.</p>
<p>He felt he must tell someone of his delight in all; lifted his
head as he strode, and so striding, inadvertently trod on the heel
of one before. The man turned to show a face as young as his
own and a clerical badge. His hands were hunched beneath the
edge of his jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your grace,&rdquo; said Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking. Did you know that the great assembly is going
to make itself a regency in the place of Queen Berdette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; A pause. &ldquo;Well, now the Tritulaccan Count will find him
a better bedfellow. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll have this Prince Pavinius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Episcopals left the assembly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Another stop to the conversation, step, step to the corner,
side by side. The encounter glanced around (with discomfort
in his eyes at having nothing to say). &ldquo;Have you seen the new
representation at Leverdaos? It is called &lsquo;The Maid&rsquo;s Problem&rsquo;
and Minora is playing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">25</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">INTERVIEW AT THE NATION&rsquo;S GUEST-HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>Lalette lay curled on the bed, half propped by pillows under
her armpit. Demad&eacute; Slair had unbelted his sword to sit down;
it leaned against his chair. Mathurin sat in the one by the table,
the candle throwing his sharp profile into strong silhouette. Rodvard
shifted in the damaged chair, whose lost stuffing made his
seat uneasy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_400">400</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that was all?&rdquo; said the writer to the assembly, pinching
his lower lip. &ldquo;Nothing more from Palm, nothing more from the
other Episcopals? Pest, Bergelin, you are less useful than I had
expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was the legist who spoke,&rdquo; said Rodvard. &ldquo;I think he
is a man to beware of. His thought was so ruthless and desirous
of power that he would ride down anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the kronzlar Escholl? That is of some use at all
events,&rdquo; said Mathurin. &ldquo;We need more like that, whether as
allies or enemies. Things must be stirred; too many people are
careless of who wins.&rdquo; He stood up and began to pace the floor
slowly, head thrust forward a little, hands behind him. &ldquo;Listen,
Bergelin, I will be wholly frank with you. We held a meeting of
the High Center this afternoon, following the session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard said; &ldquo;Are the names of its members still a secret,
except for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin gave a snort. &ldquo;They will not be long, for things have
so fallen out that the High Center and the Council of Regency
will be one. You will have guessed that Brosen Zelitza of Arjen
is one, there&rsquo;s the best speaker in Dossola. General Stegaller; he&rsquo;s
in charge of the recruit bureau technically, but is really organizing
what will be a people&rsquo;s army. It may surprise you to know
that your old friend Mme. Kaja is a member; a wonderful woman
for handling matters of detail, and we have to have one of her
sex because of our position about the Art, but I could wish it
were someone beside her, she&rsquo;s so religious.&rdquo; Lalette made a little
sound; Rodvard caught sight of her face (and knew she was about
to burst into one of her angers).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will no one tell me what has become of Doctor Remigorius?&rdquo;
he asked (hoping to forestall the outburst).</p>
<p>Mathurin&rsquo;s pacing stopped. &ldquo;I forgive you and will tell you, but
if you wish health, you will not mention him again. Rat, spy,
tool; he has fled to his employer, Prince Pavinius&mdash;but he will not
live long, so no more of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Lalette thought: these are the creatures round my husband,
my man&mdash;if he is my man, and not merely using me and my Blue
Star.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was decided&mdash;&rdquo; Mathurin began, but before he had finished,
a mouse slipped from under the edge of the bed, and ran rapidly
across the floor as though on tiny wheels. Slair&rsquo;s arm flashed up
and out with the scabbarded sword like a striking bird; blade and
beast together arrived at the center of the carpet and the mouse
twitched once and died. Demad&eacute; Slair picked up the small corpse
and stood looking at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_401">401</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor creature,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ask your pardon. Now your children
in the hole will starve for lack of the food you went in
search of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard was astounded to see a tear glitter at the edge of the
swordsman&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; said Mathurin. &ldquo;Will you defend vermin,
Slair? You&rsquo;ll have use enough for your steel when the new
decrees are passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard stirred. &ldquo;What decrees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin turned (with his back carefully to the candles, Rodvard
noted, so that his face was dark). &ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a new court,
to try special cases; it was what I was about to mention when interrupted.
Treason against the people and nation. You will be writer
to it; more important than the sessions of the assembly.&rdquo; He turned
to Lalette. &ldquo;There is also a part for you; you are one of the keys
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette said unhappily; &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As versus these Episcopals. They spread venom; represent the
greatest danger we now have to face. Pavinius? I give him a snap
of the fingers; he is too nice, with his Mayern foreigners and
western herdsmen. The Tritulaccans? Nothing by themselves, they
had never beaten Dossola in the former war but for the revolt of
Mancherei, Mayern help and the treason of the Kjermanash chieftains.
The court? Now sold to Tritulacca, and destitute by its own
action. But the Episcopals are still not out of credit with the people,
who have been lulled by their solemn mummery. We drove them
from the assembly of the nation this morning, good. But now they
may join Tritulacca in the name of what they call true religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have I to do with the Episcopals?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, fool, use your Art. Not to the death; they&rsquo;d only fill
the office with another man, but paralyze, cripple, drive idiot. The
Arch-Episcopal Groadon, notably. His loss would hurt them most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette sat up. &ldquo;Ser Mathurin, you do not by any means understand
this matter of the Art. Groadon is protected by the holy
oils, and nothing I can do will bite on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you that do not understand. I do assure you that if
Groadon be taken in a moment of anger, as today, or other violent
passion, neither his oils nor any other thing can protect him from
your ministrations. Be assured, we will provide the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette&rsquo;s mouth twitched. (She wanted to cry; &ldquo;Not for any
reward or punishment you can give!&rdquo; but) it was a moment before
she said; &ldquo;Am I the only&mdash;witch in Dossola?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_402">402</div>
<p>Mathurin made a grating sound. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll be open; we are
pressing the search. Have found three others&mdash;aside from those
who claimed the Art, but could witch nothing more consequential
than a frog or chicken. One is an old beldame who has nearly lost
her wits, and can be made to understand nothing. One&rsquo;s a young
girl&mdash;witch enough, but never taught, did not know the patterns,
and beside, she ran away. One we caught, not found&mdash;she was in
Chancellor Florestan&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo; He drew a finger across his throat.
&ldquo;None of them heiress to a Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure I can follow all the patterns myself,&rdquo; said Lalette.
&ldquo;I have used the Art&mdash;so little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mathurin looked at her sharply. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see your
slowness, but you more than another should be on our side; as
witch and woman. The Art has almost died out; driven down by
priest and Episcopal. There are likely many with the right inheritance
who do not know it. Never taught. Yet it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s defence.
We have the butler Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s Blue Star, for instance. But
where&rsquo;s the girl can bring it to life? We do not even know her
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whirled suddenly and flung out an arm toward Rodvard in
an oratorical gesture. &ldquo;Bergelin! I remember; that was the other
matter. You were in the Office of Pedigree; know its secrets. Forget
the great assembly for the time; that&rsquo;s under control. Until the
new court&rsquo;s set up your task is seeking out Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s heiress. I&rsquo;ll
give you an authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be somewhat harder than you think,&rdquo; said Rodvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say it would be easy; I said it would be done,&rdquo; said
Mathurin. &ldquo;Slair, let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>When they were out, he turned to look at Lalette. She had
sagged down, with her face in the pillow, and now without moving,
she said as before; &ldquo;Rodvard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went across the room and put an arm around her. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother. She is with the court, and she knows the patterns.
If that man takes her, he will have her throat cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The fate of many thousands, and the guarantee of the future,
with the Art not in the hands of ignorant peasants, but women of
intelligence and good will&mdash;balanced against one lie. But how to
say it?) He said; &ldquo;Has she shown so much concern for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette twisted under his arm. &ldquo;If she had, would I know it?
You hold me a prisoner&mdash;you and your Dr. Remigorius, who does
not deliver letters, and your Mme. Kaja, who will sell me, and
your Mathurin, who wants to cut my mother&rsquo;s throat. I never
knew what dirt was till I knew you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_403">403</div>
<p>(Rodvard felt the blood beat at his temples; he wanted to
strike her, to make a fiery retort.) He released her, stood up, and
began to walk the floor. (No: no. A quarrel so entered could never
be composed. Look beyond it, Rodvard; see how the world would
be without her. Somewhere perhaps there was another who would
have more response for an interior fidelity deeper than any single
act; would not drive him from her side with bitter words when
. . . He thought of Maritzl of Stojenrosek; and by this route came
again to the high purpose. No. It was mere selfishness to let his
own thought, his own problem, stand first; the very thing he had
wished to bring her to see. Keep the peace.)</p>
<p>A small sound made him turn. She was just settling into place
among the covers, and her face turned toward him. &ldquo;Oh, Rodvard,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;help me. I can&rsquo;t do it. The Episcopal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said on the subject, but that night they slept
in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">26</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE COURT OF SPECIAL CASES</span></h2>
<p>Punctual to the hour, as Rodvard and Lalette sat at breakfast
with the woman who cared for the kitchen and a Green Islands
buyer of northern wools, there arrived a messenger bearing the
authority signed by Mathurin to consult all documents and registers
in the Office of Pedigree, even those hitherto held under
ecclesiastical seal. For Lalette also, a note; the Arch-Episcopal had
declared himself in seclusion for prayer, and she would be notified
further. Between them that morning there was a truce to contention;
they walked for a while in the gardens among dead
rustling leaves, and she kissed him sweetly when he left.</p>
<p>On the way to the Office of Pedigree, Rodvard thought of Asper
Polt&eacute;n and the rest when he walked in with an authority to examine
the sealed registers, but this small triumph was denied him.
Polt&eacute;n was nowhere to be seen, and in the distributing office was
only an old, dry, dusty man Rodvard remembered as having seen
once or twice with some document close to his nose. He held Rodvard&rsquo;s
paper in the same manner, sniffed as though it had an unpleasant
odor, and shufflingly led the way to the sealed strong-room,
which he unlocked with a creaking key. There seemed fewer
people than usual in the halls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_404">404</div>
<p>The sealed files themselves showed the search likely to be a
long one; mostly old, written in crabbed hands, and largely concerned
with the illegitimacies of persons now forgotten, or convictions
of witchery in cases that now had no meaning. Of the specific
line of Tuol&eacute;n there was no trace that morning, and the older
records of families having Kjermanash blood were so badly kept
as to indicate a long search.</p>
<p>At noon, Rodvard went to a tavern and lingered over his mug
to savor the gossip of the town, but that was something of a failure,
too, for there was none of the high excitement over the doings of
the great assembly he had expected. The only group he overheard
specifically were three or four merchants at a table, rather
gloomily discussing the rise in the price of wool caused by the
troubles in the west, and the fall in the price of southern wine,
which kept coming in from oversea and could not be dispatched
to the disturbed seignories. Nobody said a word about the Episcopals;
the only time the court was mentioned, there was a little
growling over the name of Florestan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Rodvard began by setting aside the registers
that had to do with the three northernmost seignories, Bregatz,
Vivensteg and Oltrug; but the task was so wearisome and his mind
so occupied with other topics that he put them away early. It
seemed to him, as he summoned the caretaker to lock the room,
that there was nothing in the world as dear or desirable as Lalette,
if he could only somehow reach an agreement with her, all
troubles would vanish away. As he walked back toward the Ulutz
palace, he thought that if they could only sit down in the clear
winter air after last night&rsquo;s storm all coils would be unwoven.</p>
<p>But she was not in the room when he arrived, and when he
found her, it was on a bench among the garden alleys, wrapped in
a cloak and laughing as she talked to Demad&eacute; Slair. The swordsman
leaped up at his coming. &ldquo;Hail dauntless dompter of the written
page!&rdquo; he said, in a tone which was that of banter between friends,
but with something in it that made Rodvard look sharply at the
eyes. (Clear as speech, the thought came through; &ldquo;And this long-legged
booby who has never handled a weapon in his life will lie
with her tonight while I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Rodvard said, a little unevenly; &ldquo;I have made a beginning.
Are there any tidings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the assembly,&rdquo; said Slair. &ldquo;Much discussion of how to
raise troops for the people&rsquo;s army, and a report by General Stegaller.
The decree for your court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My court?&rdquo; said Rodvard (thinking of the Queen).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_405">405</div>
<p>&ldquo;That of judgment in special cases.&rdquo; (The eyes had gone blank.)
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be writer to it, as Mathurin to the assembly. If there&rsquo;s anyone
you have a grudge against, name him for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed; so did Lalette (and as Rodvard caught her eye,
he saw in it a color of regret that he could not be as gay as the
swordsman, and a wave of dislike for the man who had rescued
him from Charalkis prison contracted his veins). &ldquo;I think I saw
in the library a book by Momoroso that I have never read,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I will see you before table, Lalette.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The session will recess,&rdquo; said the kronzlar Escholl. He rose
and swept the courtroom with his curious lacklustre eye, that
never seemed to be settled on anything. &ldquo;I will go over the evidence
with you, Bergelin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legist on his right, the Zigraner, frowned; he on the left
leaned his chin on his hand and his elbow on the table. The
accused, a man with a coronet badge, iron-grey hair and heavy
dewlaps, looked disconcerted. Rodvard gathered his papers and
followed the president of the court to the little room in rear.</p>
<p>When they were there; &ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; asked the
legist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he tells the truth,&rdquo; said Rodvard, &ldquo;when he says he
has given no help to the Queen&rsquo;s party or Pavinius. When you
asked him that, however, there was something like fear&mdash;perhaps
for his brother. It was not clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; The legist placed his fingers together and studied them.
&ldquo;Bergelin,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;you are to remember that
this is a special court of inquiry. We are empowered to handle
not only direct treasons, but matters which the ordinary law holds
criminal. Such acts dissipate the resources that of right belong to
the nation. You tend to be narrow. Let us return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they came in, one of the guards nudged the prisoner forward
again. The jurist president frowned on him portentously.
&ldquo;Kettersel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a brief examination of the record shows no
evidence of your giving aid to either of the two destituted persons
who claim to rule the realm of Dossola. Unless my fellow-jurists
disagree, of that you are acquitted.&rdquo; He glanced at one and the
other; the Zigraner gave a somewhat unwilling nod, the third
legist had only an absent expression. &ldquo;But in pleading innocence
of giving such aid, you are answering a charge that has never
been brought. If you say you are not guilty of garroting people
by night in King Crotinianus&rsquo; Square, we will find you innocent
of that also, and so through a list of possible crimes, did it not
waste this court&rsquo;s time to agree with you that you have committed
none of them. But you are charged with treason to the nation,
which in its essence consists not of any specific act, but of a point
of view, which may be proved by a number of actions, in themselves
bearing an innocent appearance until they are assembled
with each other. I take it my fellow-jurists agree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_406">406</div>
<p>He looked again, and again those in the lower seats nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kettersel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;answer me. You have a brother with the
court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man cleared his throat. &ldquo;I have answered that. He is a
capellan in the Eagle Shar of Her Majesty&rsquo;s lancers.&rdquo; (The shadow
of worry was behind the man&rsquo;s eye; now deepened, and very surprising
in such a person, whom one would have expected to be
concerned about gold scudi or the fidelity of his mistress.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s lancers,&rdquo; corrected Escholl. &ldquo;Kettersel, are both
you and your brother married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only him; the Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he daughters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Only a son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your brother should fall in the fighting, where would the
inheritance lie?&rdquo; (Now the fear was at the front and perfectly
sharp; it was a fear of being left penniless.) Kettersel said slowly
(and lying); &ldquo;I am not sure; would have to consult the Office of
Pedigree. There is a cousin, I think, to whom the income would
fall. The title and the estate would pass to the son, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is the son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The jurist president moved his lips (and Rodvard observed
that the man before him was perspiring with the effort to
keep some thought down; a thought which came to the watcher
dark as sin and midnight). &ldquo;Is your nephew married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To one of the Blenau family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard signed; without appearing to see him the jurist president
said; &ldquo;Kettersel, you are engaged in concealments. It is useless.
What is the trouble between you and your nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s self-control split apart suddenly. He flung at Rodvard
a glance of purest venom and burst out; &ldquo;The damned young
puppy is trying to have his own father killed so he may have
the title for his whore of a wife. There is no reason, none at all,
why he should take a command in the Eagle Shar. He is an old
man, taking the task of that young bastard in the lancers, where
all the fighting is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_407">407</div>
<p>There was a little murmur in the courtroom. The jurist president
said; &ldquo;Why did he accept the charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It was the wrong line; Kettersel&rsquo;s eyes were perfectly clear.)
&ldquo;To spare his son, I suppose. My nephew was appointed earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard coughed. Kronzlar Escholl said; &ldquo;Where are your
nephew and his wife now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man paused (and in that pause the thing came through;
it took Rodvard a minute or two to realize what it was). &ldquo;I heard
of them last at Landensenza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard stepped up to the jurist&rsquo;s seat, with one finger on the
paper to maintain the fiction, and whispered; &ldquo;His true concern
is not his brother, but because he wishes to lie with his nephew&rsquo;s
wife. I think she may have refused him, but he still believes it
may be done somehow if the nephew can be killed before his
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Escholl put a finger beside Rodvard&rsquo;s. &ldquo;That is correct, after
all,&rdquo; and turned to the prisoner. &ldquo;Kettersel, your concern for your
brother does you the greatest credit. It is evident that you have
been in correspondence with him, but I think my brother jurists
will agree when I pronounce you guiltless of true treason and
order your release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two jurists wagged their heads silently and in unison, like
those toys with flexible necks which children play with during
the winter festival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hear the next case.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">27</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WINTER LIGHT</span></h2>
<p>As Rodvard left the courtroom, Demad&eacute; Slair fell into step
beside him. (The man was determinedly, if coldly, friendly; how
to shake him off? instead of leading him home to Lalette and another
of those conversations in three, where Rodvard felt himself
so much hearing a language he did not understand that he always
ultimately fled them for a book or the outer air.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escholl is one of our best,&rdquo; said the swordsman, kicking at
the skin of a fruit, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a judgment I failed to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one? The merchant who was confiscated for bringing
wool-carts past the Mayern camp?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_408">408</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bah, no. He had money, the nation needs it; that&rsquo;s crime
enough. I spoke of the Baron&rsquo;s brother, the noble Kettersel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more did I understand it,&rdquo; said Rodvard. &ldquo;As dirty a
character as I ever saw, but the kronzlar let him go and praised
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Slair. &ldquo;It begins to come clear. What&rsquo;s the tale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was after his nephew&rsquo;s wife&mdash;whether for her money
or her body the most, I am not sure, but he wants both.&rdquo; (He
could not resist adding); &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a poor task to break up a
couple at any time, for it destroys two people&rsquo;s chance of happiness
for the temporary pleasure of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Slair, avoiding his eyes. &ldquo;But I am interrupting.
Is there more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His only fear is that the Baron will die before the son, and
so the right of remarrying the girl will pass to another family.
I did not tell the kronzlar because it was not clear enough, but I
think he was planning murder. Yet Escholl let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slair laughed. &ldquo;Bergelin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not lose your innocence;
it may save your life some day, for no one will ever believe
you are subtle enough to be dangerous. I said Escholl was one of
our best; depend upon it, he thought more deeply than you, and
without any witch-stone to help him. Why, it is precisely because
Kettersel has murder and rape at the back of his mind that he
was let go. For exactly the opposite reason, the court will condemn
Palm as soon as there&rsquo;s a pretext for a trial. Mathurin has arranged
it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am innocent again and do not quite understand the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you will dabble in high politic! Hark, now: are not all of
the noble order enemies to the New Day by constitution, by
existence? Are not all their private virtues overwhelmed by this
public fault? The true villains among them will sooner or later
dig their own graves and save us the trouble, bringing discredit
on the whole in the process. But when you have one like Palm
or the late Baron Brunivar, he&rsquo;s dangerous; sets people to loving
the institution because they cannot hate the man, and so must
be pulled down by force. . . . For that matter, we need something
to stir the people, make them fight for their liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems a hard way,&rdquo; said Rodvard, (trying to resolve the
torsion in his mind).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_409">409</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a hard life, and hardest for those who avoid battle,&rdquo;
said Demad&eacute; Slair; and Rodvard not replying, they walked in
silence. (Would this new system somehow produce men of better
heart and purpose? For he did not see how the hardness could
be justified else. And now his mind fell to wagging between man-system,
system-man, and he decided that the justification of the
system would be that it produced better men generally, and not
merely a few of the best. No, not that either, for that was to
confuse politic with ethic, and each was itself a system; for the
one would make men good without regard to their happiness,
and the other make them happy without regard to their good.
. . . Or what was good? Where was the standard? By the system
of Mancherei&mdash;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go on to the quays?&rdquo; said Slair&rsquo;s voice, suddenly,
and Rodvard found himself three steps beyond the entrance to
the Palace Ulutz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am weary tonight,&rdquo; said Rodvard. &ldquo;Perhaps because I am
so innocent that this affair of spying upon the minds of my fellows
is somewhat unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand to bid goodnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am going with you,&rdquo; said the swordsman, and as he
caught Rodvard&rsquo;s glance of aversion. &ldquo;I cannot bear to be without
your company.&rdquo; His face went sober as he quick-stepped beside
Rodvard&rsquo;s dragging feet up the entrance-walk. &ldquo;This is Mathurin&rsquo;s
arrangement, also, in case it troubles you. Did you not notice
those two men who followed us from the court at half a square&rsquo;s
distance? There will be another outside tonight. People&rsquo;s guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A tremor of peril.) &ldquo;But I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done nothing but your duty to the nation. True; and for
that reason precisely it is needful to guard you like an egg sought
after by weasels. Do you think that the fact you bear a Blue Star
is a secret? There are not a few persons who may be brought
before the court that would rather conceal an assassination than
what they have in their minds. You and I may have a fight on
our hands.&rdquo; His face lighted with pleasure at the prospect.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>They paced slowly through the dead garden, along a walk
so narrow that shoulders sometimes touched. Lalette could hear
the tiny tinkle of the chain that bound Slair&rsquo;s sword to his hip
when that touch came; she knew he was stirred, and the rousing
of emotion was not unpleasant to her. Beyond the slate roofs of
the town the sun was sinking redly through striations of cloud;
all things lay in a peace that was the peace of the end of the
world. He turned his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what will you give for news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You spoil it. For a moment I was
immortal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_410">410</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ask your grace. But truly I have news for you, and it should
please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here and tell me.&rdquo; She took her place on a marble bench
beneath the skeleton of an espaliered peach against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not have to use your Art against the arch-priest
Groadon. Does that not please you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you know. What is the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has fled; slipped through the watch set on his palace
and gone&mdash;whether to hell, the court or Tritulacca, no one knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo; She looked straight before her for a moment. &ldquo;Ah,
if things were better ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not as pleased as you might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am. But Rodvard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he done? I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no fault of his. You will tell no one?&rdquo; She laid a cold
hand on his warm one. &ldquo;He has found who the heiress of Tuol&eacute;n
is, but does not know whether to tell Mathurin or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child, thirteen years old. She lives at Dyolana, up in Oltrug
seignory. But I do not know how long Rodvard will keep the
secret. He feels a sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he not? What withholds him from telling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have to teach her the patterns and everything. I do
not wish it.&rdquo; She shivered slightly. &ldquo;And to be a witch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rising shades had drowned the sun. A silence came on
the garden, so utter that Lalette felt she could hear her own heart
beat, and Demad&eacute; Slair&rsquo;s beside her. The trees stood straight; the
ruins of the flowers did not stir. In that enchanted stillness she
seemed to float without power of motion. He leaned toward her,
his arm close against her back, his other hand crept over her two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demoiselle&mdash;Lalette,&rdquo; he said in a voice so low it did not
break the quiet. &ldquo;I love you. Come away with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her down-bent head shook slowly; tears gathered behind the
almost-closed eyes.</p>
<p>The arm around her back slid slowly beneath her own arm,
the hand groped to close slowly around one soft breast; as though
it were by no volition of her own, her head came back to meet
the kiss. The tears ran down her cheek to touch his; he drew
from her and began to speak rapidly in a voice low and urgent:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_411">411</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me. I will take you away from every unhappiness.
We can go beyond finding. I am a fighting man, can find a need
for my service anywhere. It does not matter; we can forget all
this entanglement and make our own world. I have money enough.
We can go to the Green Islands, and you will never have to use
the Art again. Oh, Lalette, I would even take you to the court
and join your mother. Do you wish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips barely moving, she said; &ldquo;And Rodvard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her again. &ldquo;Bergelin? You owe him nothing. What
has he done for you? And now he will tell Mathurin about the
heiress of Tuol&eacute;n, and there will be no more place for you&mdash;except
with me. I will always have a place for you, Lalette, now
or a thousand years from now. Or do you fear him? I am the
better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now her eyes opened wide on the first star, low in the darkening
sky, and with one hand she gently disengaged his clasp from
her breast. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in a voice clearer than before. &ldquo;No,
Demad&eacute;, I cannot. Perhaps for that reason, but I cannot. We
had better go in now.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Friend Ber-ge-lin! Friend Ber-ge-lin!&rdquo; The voice from below-stairs
brought back to a consciousness of unhappiness the mind
that had lost itself in the sweet cadences and imagined worlds
of Momoroso. Rodvard sprang up and threw open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the hall another door closed. It would be the little
old man who asked so many questions and went almost a-tiptoe,
as though always prepared to look through a keyhole. From the
stairhead, Rodvard could see in the evening&rsquo;s first shades a figure
covered with a long cloak, somehow familiar, but the face hooded
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg her to come up,&rdquo; he called. The figure mounted with
one hand on the bannister, in the slow manner of the old. Near
the last step his mind clicked; he was not surprised when in the
room the hood fell back to show Mme. Kaja. Face cold as ice,
he remained standing. She came across the room in a whirl of
skirts, with both hands out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My de-ear boy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>With the hangings at the windows, it was too dim to tell how
far her sincerity went. &ldquo;I am more than honored to have one of
the regents&mdash;,&rdquo; he said, and let it hang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_412">412</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are the most necessary of all,&rdquo; she said, and frou-froued
to the best chair. &ldquo;I hope you have forgiven me. It was
so-o-o necessary; someone had filed an information with the provosts
that I was part of the New Day, and it was such a help.
Isn&rsquo;t it to-o bad about the Episcopals not cooperating? But there
are so many of the priests on our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had seated herself where her face was in the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, why have you come?&rdquo; he asked brutally.</p>
<p>There was a silence in the darkening room. Then: &ldquo;To help
you,&rdquo; said the voice that, though it might no longer sing, had
not lost its silver in speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stirred. &ldquo;Do not. It is better so . . . I know&mdash;you are
thinking of the Blue Star. Do you imagine that I fear your using
it? No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat quietly (noting with the back of his mind how the
dubious nicety had dropped from her voice, and thinking that
this was the woman who had been taken into the High Center).
Once more she seemed to gather her forces. &ldquo;Rodvard Bergelin,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;do you know why I am in the High Center?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I . . . think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you. It may be that in my ancestry there is a strain
from one of the witch-families. It may be because I sincerely
serve God. I do not know. But it has been given to me to be able
to trace certain secrets of the heart.&rdquo; Her multitudinous bracelets
jingled as she lifted a hand to her breast. &ldquo;Not as you do with
the Blue Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent again, and he (unable to restrain an impulse
toward malice) said; &ldquo;Your success in understanding Dr. Remigorius
was&mdash;as great as my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodvard, you are so-o unfair.&rdquo; She dropped for a moment into
the old manner, then seemed to shake herself. &ldquo;I know. Your&mdash;witch
will never forgive me. Not that I brought the provosts,
but that I came in that day when you were on the bed. I do
not care; she brings an evil Art into our New Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodvard, hear me. This witch, to whom you are affected, will
one day be the end of you. I have seen her but little, yet I know&mdash;it
is your nature to give offense, and hers to take it. Sooner or
later it will happen that she will find something not to be borne
and put a witchery on you that will strike like lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(This clipped him close; with a certain convulsion round the
heart, he remembered Lalette&rsquo;s occasional sudden rages.) &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;what would you have me do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bid her farewell. Both of you can find partners better suited.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_413">413</div>
<p>Rodvard came to his feet and walked across the room slowly
(thinking in little flashes of sweet Leece and Maritzl of Stojenrosek).
Mme. Kaja sat immobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Better or worse, I will not give her up for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. Kaja also stood. &ldquo;Forgive an old woman,&rdquo; she said, and
gathering her cloak around her, slipped out the door.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">28</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">EMBERS REVIVED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We will hear the next case,&rdquo; said the kronzlar Escholl.</p>
<p>The people&rsquo;s guard opened the door to the room of the accused
and called, &ldquo;Bring her in,&rdquo; while a sharp-faced countryman stepped
forward from the rear of the court, two more guards behind him.
The countryman had a merchant&rsquo;s badge and so quick an eye that
Rodvard gazed at him, fascinated to see what it would tell, and
was therefore unprepared when he turned his head to see the
accused.</p>
<p>It was Maritzl of Stojenrosek.</p>
<p>A Maritzl pale behind her red lips, still even when she moved,
and much changed. (How? Rodvard asked himself and could find
no answer but in a certain lessening of fibre that was expressed
around the mouth, though the breathtaking thrill of her presence
was still so much there that he swallowed.) The craggy-faced
prosecutor stepped forward. &ldquo;I present an accusation of treason
against the nation on the part of the Demoiselle Maritzl of Stojenrosek,
mistress of Count Cleudi, the foreign traitor. I call the innkeeper
of Drog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Mistress of Count Cleudi?&rdquo; and Drog?) The sharp-faced man
stood forth. Maritzl turned to look at him, and as her eyes turned
back, they fell on Rodvard. She started (and before she looked
down again he caught from them an arrow of purest and most astounding
hatred). &ldquo;Tell us your story,&rdquo; said the jurist president.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep a good house,&rdquo; said the man, twisting his cap in his
hands, &ldquo;and I have to be careful to preserve its reputation, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prosecutor touched his arm. &ldquo;Give your condition first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_414">414</div>
<p>Head bobbed. &ldquo;Thank you, friend. I am keeper of the inn Star
of Dossola at Drog, on the road through the Pass of Pikes in the
Ragged Mountains, and mine is the largest inn there, with three
upper rooms beside the general chamber.&rdquo; (Maritzl was looking at
him again, not now with hatred, but weariness of the world, and
the thought that he, Rodvard, was as dreary as any part of it.) &ldquo;It
has never been necessary for the provosts to come to my place
except when I called them. Now when this woman came into my
inn, I knew right away that something was wrong. Late at night
it was, and she in a three-horse coach with a driver, and that seemed
strange&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prosecutor halted him again. &ldquo;Explain why you thought
something was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her; she comes evidently from the court and bears the
marks of it.&rdquo; He jabbed a finger at the girl, but it was Rodvard she
looked at (a long slow glance, in which was some decision to
make a desperate appeal). &ldquo;When I saw her, I think to myself, as
a man often will, that this is not the place for a court woman to
be, not with the court in Zenss. So I think this is a good one to
watch and perhaps I will learn something, and while she is
supping&mdash;she sat apart from the coachmaster in the high dining
room, she did&mdash;while she was supping, I served her myself and
marked how there was a little casket she kept beside herself and
touched her hand to, even while she was eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Her face now outwardly held the appeal, but a plan was
building in her mind; he could see it grow stone by stone, but not
clearly what it was, because little hate-flashes kept jagging across
the picture.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said to her that if her casket was that precious, I ought to
hold it in the strongbox of the inn, there being so many wandering
soldiers about. When I said this, her ladyship&mdash;&rdquo; he grinned a vulpine
grin to show this was intended for a joke &ldquo;&mdash;said no, she would
as soon lose her life as the casket, which being so small, I think it
must have in it something beside jewels. So I said to myself, here
is some mystery, but if anyone can unlock it, it is my friend Khlab,
that was a provost of the court at Sedad Vix till it was broken up.
So while her ladyship was at the dessert, I slipped out to find my
friend Khlab, and let him walk past the door to look at her. The
minute he saw her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said the prosecutor, and addressed the court.
&ldquo;I present the former provost Khlab, now a people&rsquo;s guard.&rdquo; He motioned
to a man behind, who took the innkeeper&rsquo;s place. &ldquo;Tell your
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_415">415</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your&mdash;friend. I saw her through the door as I went past
and I knew her at once for Maritzl of Stojenrosek because I had
seen her before. She is the one Count Cleudi brought to Sedad Vix
to be his mistress after the spring festival. I told this to friend
Brezel, and he said if she was as close as that to Cleudi, she had
no business in Drog. So we went in and under pain of the sword,
made her give up the casket. It had some jewels in it, but underneath
the lining was the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter is here,&rdquo; said the prosecutor, handing up a parchment,
partly torn, but bearing the unmistakable blue star seal. &ldquo;It
is a document already famous, in which Cleudi beseeches the aid
of the Tritulaccans in return for cessions of territory. Most treasonable
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm&mdash;hm,&rdquo; said kronzlar Escholl, looking at it as though he had
never seen it before. The Zigraner jurist craned his neck. (Her plan
was complete now;) she took one step forward and in a low urgent
whisper said; &ldquo;Rodvard, help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It was an entreaty, and as though she knew of the use of the
jewel, she was projecting a promise behind the entreaty; and the
plan was behind the promise. But it was as though that &ldquo;Help me&rdquo;
laid a compulsion on him.) Rodvard turned round, as Escholl was
handing the parchment to the third jurist. &ldquo;Your pardon, kronzlar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frown. &ldquo;Very well, I will see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodvard stepped to the bench and whispered; &ldquo;She is thinking
of some sort of plan, I do not know for what. I think I could find
out, if I could question her alone. I knew her in the old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Escholl addressed the court. &ldquo;This is perhaps the foulest piece
of treason in the history of Dossola; and we have proof that the
message is no forgery in the recent march of the Tritulaccan shars
over the southern border, and the delivery to them without a battle
of the castle of Falsteg. It is evident that the accused had full
knowledge of the contents of this letter, and is therefore guilty of
taking part in a vile conspiracy against the nation. But this court
is required to follow every treason to its source, not merely to establish
individual guilts. We will postpone this matter for inquiry,
and pass to the next case.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Rodvard sprang up as she was led into the room, hurrying to
get her one of the comfortless chairs from the row against the
wall. The guard leered at him (with a thought so nasty that) Rodvard&rsquo;s
tongue stumbled as he said; &ldquo;She wants to&mdash;tell me something
in private.&rdquo; The guard laughed, glanced at the barred window
and slammed the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_416">416</div>
<p>Maritzl said; &ldquo;Rodvard, I do not want to go to the throat-cutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Her hands clenched, fingers entwined in fingers. &ldquo;Take me
away. You are the writer to this court. Can you not make an order
or something for my release to be transported elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(This was the plan, but it was not the whole plan; and yet
under the magic of her presence, the words seemed to count more
than what lay behind them.) &ldquo;It&mdash;it would be very difficult,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The order would have to be countersigned, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are a writer!&rdquo; A note of scorn in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;I should forge the signature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? This regency of yours is hopeless. I have been confined,
but even I know that. How many shar of soldiers do you
order? Enough to fight the court and all Tritulacca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Now it was Rodvard&rsquo;s turn to be uneasy, for he had asked
himself these questions.) &ldquo;The people will rise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they risen yet? Where are their weapons? How many
leaders do you have who can set a battle in order? Pavinius will
never fight with the Tritulaccans; they&rsquo;ll compose.&rdquo; (Now genuine
black anger jutted from her eyes.) &ldquo;All you can do, here in this
little dream-world, is lay the ground for vengeance on yourselves.&rdquo;
She was near enough to reach out a hand and touch him. &ldquo;Take me
away. I do not want to go to the throat-cutter, and I do not want
you to, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would have me betray . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Her eyes flashed a resolve;) before he could say more, she
was out of her chair, arms around his shoulders, cheek caressing
his head. &ldquo;Ah, Rodvard, I will make it up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up in the circle of her arms; her head tilted back, the
long lashes lying on her cheek over veiled eyes. (Mistake, he
thought, a sudden rivulet of cold running down his spine. It cannot
be true, you were hating me a moment ago; I think I see your
plan now.)</p>
<p>He held her off with rough hands on her shoulders. &ldquo;You are
Cleudi&rsquo;s mistress,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The liquid flesh changed to brass, the eyes snapped open as
she shook herself free. &ldquo;Yes, I am Cleudi&rsquo;s mistress,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And
whose fault is it? I was a good girl once; I would have given you
everything and remained good, no matter what I did for you. You
did not want me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_417">417</div>
<p>She was down in the chair again, crying through her fingers.
&ldquo;You are too much like him,&rdquo; she said, and he (wrung by the
thought of that fair neck delivered to the executioner) laid a hand
on her shoulder and said; &ldquo;I will do what I can.&rdquo; Now kronzlar
Escholl must be persuaded, if possible, that though there had been
treason, it was treason done for love and could be passed over.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Rodvard came in late, and had had no supper save some bread
and cheese caught at an inn with the two people&rsquo;s guards who
accompanied him, Demad&eacute; Slair having left long before. Lalette
was arranging her hair before the mirror, with a candle on either
side, and did not turn round. (At the sight of her lifted graceful
arms, a wave of tenderness swept over him.) &ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he said,
almost lilting the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo; She still did not turn, and the voice was formal.</p>
<p>He hurried across the room in long steps and turned her around.
&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an impatient movement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. You will spoil my
hair. Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalette, there is something. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kept her eyes away from him. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and then, as he
merely stood, waiting in burning intensity; &ldquo;A small thing, truly.
You need not be troubled. Only I know now who it was you were
unfaithful to me with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He was hot and cold together.) &ldquo;Who says I was unfaithful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you come with me now?&rsquo;&rdquo; she quoted. &ldquo;Rodvard, you
may be able to read some of my thoughts, but do not forget why.
Is she a witch, too? She must be, or my Blue Star that I lent you
would be dead. Or did she give you another before you shared her
with Count Cleudi?&rdquo; (She wanted to hurt him as she had been
hurt, to make him regret and feel that no regret in any fashion
could replace what had been lost.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shared her with Count Cleudi?&rdquo; (He could feel honest indignation
now.) &ldquo;Lalette, who are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you saved her life,&rdquo; said she, still not looking at him.
&ldquo;It is a pity my hair is dark and my skin muddy. When these
troubles are over, you can have a good time with her on the estate.
It is in &rsquo;Zada, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The indignation no longer needed to be pushed; all he could
think of was how he had rejected the shell of that Maritzl once
desired.) He said; &ldquo;Lalette, I swear to you that I have never been
with Maritzl of Stojenrosek, if that is the one you mean. I swear
that I never will, I don&rsquo;t even want her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_418">418</div>
<p>(The accent of sincerity was making her doubt, but the bitterness
persisted beneath, she had only lost the line somewhere, and
was not yet ready to release him.) &ldquo;If you are really in love with
her, you may go. Only I&rsquo;ll not be one of your&mdash;casual contacts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He was invaded by despair of making her understand, with or
without the fullest tale of the maid Damaris and the witch of Kazmerga.)
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it would seem to me that it is asked of
any pair who live together to protect each other from casual contacts
by one means or another. But this is merely not true. Will
you listen to every talebearer who tries to split us apart for reasons
of his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered her head (melting a little, knowing he knew of
Demad&eacute; Slair&rsquo;s desire, if not of her own temptation). &ldquo;There are
some tales you might have borne to me yourself instead of letting
me learn them by hazard. Why did you betray me by telling Mathurin
of the child of Dyolana, Tuol&eacute;n&rsquo;s heiress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now he took her strongly by the shoulders. &ldquo;Lalette,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I never told him. You accuse me of being liar and betrayer, do
you think I am a fool as well? If Mathurin knows of her, he has
learned it through some other source; you are the only one I told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Suddenly and dreadfully, she knew where that other source
was&mdash;that night in the garden, when she herself told Demad&eacute; Slair,
Mathurin&rsquo;s voice and sword.) She moved close, putting both arms
around him in a convulsive gesture. &ldquo;Oh, Rodvard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
am afraid. He is having her brought here, and will make her a
witch himself&mdash;that little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to cry then. That night, as they sought and received
from each other whatever comfort passion could give, she touched
him and said; &ldquo;It is true. I am a witch and your partner. The great
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="h2line1">29</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NO AND YES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You helped me so much before,&rdquo; said Lalette.</p>
<p>The widow Domijaiek contemplated her tranquilly from among
the husks of characters who never lived. &ldquo;Yet you are again in need
of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Myonessae. I could not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_419">419</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could not give up the desires of this false, material world
for the God of love. However, it is not necessary to agree with
everything that is done under the rule of the Prophet, and when
the mattern and the diaconals tried to force you to an advancement
for which you were not ready, they were also submitting to the
rule of Evil. It is asked only to take steps we are prepared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lalette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know whether I can help you. Let us examine circumstance.
Are you still stricken by lack of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not thought of it. Rodvard touches the fees of the court
where he is writer. Our needs are small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s smile was approving. &ldquo;That is an element of
progress. But he receives these fees because he uses the witchery
of the Blue Star, does he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is an element contrary to progress and very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalette looked at the floor. &ldquo;I know. Everything seems to be
a danger. I am so afraid of Mathurin. He keeps those guards
around Rodvard, but I think they are more like jailers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing you must not do is let fear enter your heart; for it
will breed fearful things. Remember that all in this false material
world is only the reflection of your thoughts. Have you any word
from your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A man brought a note. She wants me to escape and join
her at the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to see her again. . . .&rdquo; Lalette looked up to see
Dame Domijaiek watching her attentively, though she remained
very quiet, and under the pressure of that silent scrutiny, the girl
moved. &ldquo;She is under Count Cleudi&rsquo;s protection. And I told you
about Demad&eacute;; he is very kind and gay, and I think he is in love
with me, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told Mathurin about the little girl, the heiress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was also trying to do the best for you, in his own way.
Do you want to go? Or would you rather stay with Rodvard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a small voice, Lalette said; &ldquo;I think I would rather stay with
him. Is it wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it is done in love and good will, rather than for any
hope of gain. Have you asked him to take you away from the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. This&mdash;regency is so much to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow stirred. &ldquo;You will find help, child. Come to me again
when he makes a plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_420">420</div>
<p>She stood up, but before the words of farewell could be pronounced,
the door was flung open and the boy Laduis burst in,
crying; &ldquo;Mother! I was at the market, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laduis, we have a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked embarrassed and made to Lalette the bow of a
miniature courtier. &ldquo;Oh, I remember you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are the
Princess Sunimaa, only you are not cold any more. I am glad to
see you.&rdquo; He turned again. &ldquo;Mother, everybody at the market is
excited. They say there has been a battle in the Ragged Mountains,
and Prince Pavinius has beaten the Tritulaccans and taken three of
their generals, and the rest of them are all running away.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>She had gone quietly to sleep; Rodvard had to rouse her with
the finger-touch behind the right ear that wakens without shock.
Even then, she tried for a moment to draw him close until he whispered;
&ldquo;We must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond the window there was only cold wintry starshine and
little enough of that; but Rodvard had hoped for snow or rain.
Lalette gathered her smallest of bundles; he led along the balcony
three windows down, to where the trellis was, and stepped off
backward into night, resting a moment on each step before taking
the next. Lalette&rsquo;s dresses almost made her stumble on the last
steps; she sank into his arms with a little gasp at the bottom. They
had carefully worked out the matter of getting over the garden-wall,
from the barrel to the shed-roof, the shed-roof to the wall
itself.</p>
<p>It was too late for the bracket-torch on the back street to have
remained alight. As soon as she was down, they dodged shivering
past the plane-trees, across, around a corner and into the appointed
alley. Something jingled; the man said; &ldquo;Are you the travellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dame Domijaiek&rsquo;s travellers,&rdquo; said Rodvard, as agreed, and;
&ldquo;Here is your horse and your let-pass,&rdquo; the other.</p>
<p>Rodvard got up first; the man, whose features remained indistinguishable,
helped Lalette up behind and gave them a farewell
in tones not unfriendly. Rodvard had seldom followed the maze of
streets toward the northwest quarter, but it was fairly easy to
maintain direction, and there was only one gate leading to the
Archer&rsquo;s Highroad. The horse walked, and Lalette felt so sleepy
that it was almost agony to keep her place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_421">421</div>
<p>There was no one moving on any street and hardly a light at
any window. Once a wrong turn led into a blind alley, but that
did not hold them back long, and now they were in the shadow of
the gate, with a sentry barring the path with a pike and another
holding up a lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine hour to be leaving the city,&rdquo; grumbled the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hours are fine when one must go,&rdquo; said Rodvard, and produced
his paper; this was the moment of test.</p>
<p>The sentry puzzled over it a moment, looked back at them, to
the paper again, and said; &ldquo;Pass friends.&rdquo; As he turned back to the
sentry-cachet with his pike-bearing companion, Rodvard caught
a fragment of words &ldquo;. . . won&rsquo;t be too glad to see that couple,&rdquo; and
wondered what the paper had said.</p>
<p>As they reached the far end of the bridge, where the ancient
stone leopard stands, he urged his mount to trot, but the pace
was too fast for Lalette, she had to beg him not to. They moved for
a long time through a space without figures until, like a conjurer&rsquo;s
trick, trees and houses began to appear in grey outline around
them, and then slowly to take on color. The road turned leftward,
and the river was beyond, with ice on it. Lalette said; &ldquo;Rodvard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not turn his head. &ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking you away from&mdash;everything. Your new day, the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive. I had to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent again, and in that silence the sun grew behind
streaked clouds. Lalette was so tired and sore that she felt
she must say something about it, but just before endurance reached
its limit, they came to the famous bridge of boats at Gogau, with
its inn on the opposite bank, and Rodvard said; &ldquo;Let us rest here
and take refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He helped her down and inside to a seat, still without words,
and a round-cheeked innkeeper came to them with a good morning.
After he had gone, Rodvard said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . I do not know quite what I wished or what I wish
now; but I am sure it is not to be compelled to use all I have in
Mathurin&rsquo;s way. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared across the room away from her, and she (grateful
that he was not looking to read her thought with the Blue Star)
said; &ldquo;Do you think he can make his regency stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but I think not in the long run. If Prince Pavinius
has beaten the Tritulaccans so badly . . .&rdquo; He touched the
jacket where the cold stone lay. &ldquo;This is not me, and I&rsquo;ll not be
ruled by it, no more than you by your gift of witchery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered slightly. &ldquo;It is a gift I never wished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_422">422</div>
<p>Now his face showed trouble. He stood up and paced the floor,
then turned to the inn portal, where after a moment she joined him,
looking out. The sun had daunted down the clouds, picking everything
out in winter&rsquo;s white gold; beneath them the river hurried
past, carrying little pieces of ice against the black boats. At last
he said; &ldquo;Somewhere I have lost the line. . . . I suppose that the
most we can do is try to use the lesser evil to overcome the greater,
forgiving what we can. . . . It is I who ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put an arm around his waist. &ldquo;You do not need to. I think
I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an enchanted moment they stood so. Then Rodvard&rsquo;s hands
went to his neck, and with a swift motion, he drew out the Blue
Star, over his head and holding it in his hand, glanced at the
stream and then at Lalette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. It made only a small splash where it struck the
water.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="h2line1">Epilogue</span></h2>
<p>In view of the speed with which the low-hung clouds were
driving past the window, there would evidently be no business
with ducks that day. Hodge helped himself to more coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what happened to them afterward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; said Penfield. &ldquo;When an emotional problem
is solved, the others become unreal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t consider poverty a real problem?&rdquo; asked McCall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in a social and relative sense. Go look at the natives in
the hill-country of any Latin-American state. They live on rice,
beans and fifteen cents a day, and remain quite happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodge said; &ldquo;I agree that poverty is a minor matter in this
particular case. But it seems to me that you&rsquo;re assuming too much
when you speak of the emotional problem of that couple as
solved. It&rsquo;s not like a sum in arithmetic, with a simple answer in
definite figures. There are all sorts of sub- and side-problems involved,
to which no definite values can be assigned. For instance,
isn&rsquo;t the memory of the girl, Leece, together with one of Lalette&rsquo;s
outbursts of temper, going to produce an explosive mixture at some
point? And aren&rsquo;t they keeping a good deal from each other?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_423">423</div>
<p>Penfield&rsquo;s long face was thoughtful. &ldquo;There are secrets in the
background of every union,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even secrets as black as
the murder by witchcraft, and as inexplicable as the failure and
recovery of the Blue Star. But it seems to me that they are like
the disagreements of parties in a politically stable state. Once the
essential agreement to abide has been reached, any difficulties
can be resolved or compromised. Another thing&mdash;these people have
a capacity for . . . well, close attunement to each other. More of
it than we have. What puzzles me&mdash;&rdquo; he took a pull at his cigarette
&ldquo;&mdash;is a certain preoccupation with sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCall laughed. &ldquo;Since it was the product of all three of us,
that probably came out of Hodge&rsquo;s mind somehow. Persons of
your age and mine . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodge said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it came from, but I think I
can explain it. It goes with religion, which is so often an outgrowth
of sex&mdash;or a substitute for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What really interests me,&rdquo; said McCall, &ldquo;is what happened in
a political sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the short-range developments seem fairly obvious,&rdquo; said
Penfield, &ldquo;and long-range ones are always unpredictable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it really exists,&rdquo; said Hodge, as Penfield had the
night before.</p>
<p>Penfield got up, went to the window, and looked out at the
scudding clouds. &ldquo;I wonder if we do,&rdquo; he said.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
